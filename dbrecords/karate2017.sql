Change the size of thumbnails</strong></p>\n<p>In the plugin, step 3 Options tab, Skin Options, change the value of the option "Thumbnail width / height". You can also specify a different size for medium and small size screen devices.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Change the height of the thumbnail title</strong></p>\n<p>In the plugin, step 3 Options tab, Advanced Options, enter the following text to the Advanced Options box:</p>\n<p><code>data-thumbtitleheight=60</code></p>\n<p>The above code will change the height of the thumbnail title to 60px.</p>\n<p><b>3. Add multiple lines text to the thumbnail and customise the style</b></p>\n<p>In the plugin, step 1, when adding an image or a video, you can directly enter HTML code to the Title input box to create multiple lines, you can also use CSS code to specify the style of the text. </p>\n<p>For example, in the following gallery example, the text of the first image is as following:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">\r\n&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:1.4em;line-height:2em;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Kitten&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Free image from &lt;a href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unsplash&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\r\n</pre>\n<p>The above code creates two lines of text. It also creates a link by directly using the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag.</p>\n<p>Here is the gallery example:</p>\n<div class="wonderplugingallery-container" id="wonderplugingallery-container-34" style="max-width:900px;margin:0 auto;"><div class="wonderplugingallery" id="wonderplugingallery-34" data-galleryid="34" data-width="900" data-height="506" data-skin="mediapage" data-thumbtitleheight=60 data-random="false" data-autoslide="false" data-autoplayvideo="false" data-schemamarkup="false" data-hidetitlewhenvideoisplaying="false" data-disablehovereventontouch="false" data-autoslideandplayafterfirstplayed="false" data-html5player="true" data-responsive="true" data-fullwidth="false" data-showtitle="false" data-showdescription="false" data-showplaybutton="false" data-showfullscreenbutton="false" data-showtimer="true" data-showcarousel="true" data-galleryshadow="false" data-slideshadow="false" data-thumbshowtitle="true" data-thumbshadow="false" data-lightboxshowtitle="true" data-lightboxshowdescription="true" data-specifyid="true" data-donotinit="false" data-addinitscript="false" data-triggerresize="false" data-thumbcolumnsresponsive="false" data-showimgtitle="false" data-titlesmallscreen="false" data-initsocial="true" data-showsocial="false" data-showfacebook="true" data-showtwitter="true" data-showpinterest="true" data-socialrotateeffect="true" data-doshortcodeontext="false" data-duration="1500" data-slideduration="1000" data-slideshowinterval="6000" data-googleanalyticsaccount="" data-resizemode="fill" data-imagetoolboxmode="mouseover" data-effect="fade" data-padding="0" data-bgcolor="" data-bgimage="" data-thumbwidth="300" data-thumbheight="180" data-thumbgap="10" data-thumbrowgap="16" data-lightboxtextheight="72" data-lightboxtitlecss="{color:#333333;

For example:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">\r\n&lt;div style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;\r\n[wonderplugin_gridgallery id=29]\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\r\n&lt;div

However, when I navigate to that page, it is blank.

That changed a few years ago (2012 to be exact) when Google wanted to weed out websites that may have good domain names but very little “substance”.</p>\n<p>Exact Match Domains (EMD) is where the problem started. Businesses would essentially purchase keyword domains to rank for a particular keyword. And the EMD was enough for them to rank: they barely focused on quality content and relevance (two things that matter greatly for SEO nowadays). That strategy no longer works.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that domain names no longer affect SEO. They still do (and studies have proven that), but how?</p>\n<p>Let’s find out.</p>\n<h2>How Domain Names Impact SEO</h2>\n<p>There have been a lot of changes to SEO, particularly from the largest search engine: Google. But one thing that hasn’t changed, but has been emphasized more, is original quality content, relevance and always aligning with search engine best practices. A component of this is your domain name &#8211; it’s unique, only you can have it.</p>\n<p>Even though it may not directly impact your rankings anymore, a good domain name will get you more brand recognition, trust and higher click-through-rates (CTR).</p>\n<p>However, the definition of a good domain name has changed, at least according to Google. We see this in how the search engine treats certain types of domains.</p>\n<h2>Exact Match Domains (EMD)</h2>\n<p>EMDs are domain names that include keyword phrases. For example, let’s say you are selling hair products and want to rank for “quality hair products.” The EMD you would most likely use is qualityhairproducts.com. Just purchasing that domain would have gotten you the first page ranking a while ago.</p>\n<p>Yup! You wouldn’t have needed original content or backlinks. You would simply rank for it with your domain name. That all changed after Google released the Exact Match Domain Update.</p>\n<p>The update essentially made EMDs obsolete in search engine rankings. In fact, a study by High Position showed that the average EMD ranking went from position 13.4 to 26.6 (yikes!) after Google’s update. The average top 10 EMD also dropped in rankings: from 3.2 down to 11.9. So now we know that choosing an exact match domain in 2017 is quite pointless, a bad idea even.</p>\n<p>So how should you decide on a domain name to maximize SEO? You need only do two things: choose a memorable brand name (to make your domain name) and pick a .com extension.</p>\n<p>Let’s go into more detail.</p>\n<h2>Your Brand Name Should Be Your Domain Name</h2>\n<p>We can all agree that your brand is important. Your brand name is how your customers recognize and find you in search engines and social media platforms. So think of your domain name as the foothold of your online brand.</p>\n<p>In fact, the more customers are using your brand name to search for you online, the more your SEO and rankings will improve. This is referred to as brand signalling (any reference of your business online). Matt Cutts, former Head of Web Spam at Google, claimed that Google “actually came up with a classifier to say, okay, IRS or Wikipedia or New York Times is over on this side, and the low-quality sites are over on this side.”</p>\n<p>That’s right, Google now cares more about brands for SEO than it does about keywords and links. For that reason, using your brand name is more important than keywords. You’re probably scratching your head at this point, wondering how Google would associate your brand with certain keywords&#8230;</p>\n<p>Well, Google will associate keywords with your brand as your brand becomes more popular; and as you produce more relevant and high quality content. Let’s take a look at Bitly as an example. It’s a URL shortener and link management platform yet their brand name does not match those keywords. It however ranks at the top for those keywords in Google.</p>\n<p>That’s because of its popularity. As long as people recognize it and are searching for it, Google will measure that brand signal and rank it accordingly. For this reason, it is important to have a memorable brand name and consequently, a memorable domain name.</p>\n<p>Don’t worry if your brand name contains a keyword, or in other words, is a PMD (partial match domain). That’s because Google is only searching for spam sites with EMDs and PMDs &#8211; the actual problem isn’t the keywords, but rather the content and quality of the site. A PMD or EMD with bad user experience and low quality content would experience a steep downgrade in rankings. Whereas, a PMD or EMD with great user experience and content would not be greatly affected.</p>\n<p><em>However</em>, if you are just starting out, you should go with a memorable brand name domain and avoid using keywords.</p>\n<h2>Opt For a .com Extension</h2>\n<p>You probably already know that .com is the most popular domain extension. That is because most other domain extensions like .biz and .us are viewed as spam. Although choosing it may not directly impact your rankings, you may be viewed as a low-ranking site which could affect your SEO.</p>\n<p>.com is simply the most convenient and safest choice to go with. When in doubt, go with it.</p>\n<h2>Tips for Choosing the Perfect Domain Name</h2>\n<p>Now let’s recap and go over the tips on picking the best domain name:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use your brand name</li>\n<li>Don’t use exact match domains. Partial match domains are OK but a brand name is always more effective</li>\n<li>Choose a .com extension</li>\n<li>Make it memorable so users can easily remember it</li>\n<li>Keep it short, 15 characters at most</li>\n<li>Avoid numbers, hyphens and special characters</li>\n<li>Avoid misspelling words on purpose. It’s a no-no for branding</li>\n<li>Make it easy to spell</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>We hope you now have a good understanding of how domain names affect SEO in 2017. If you’re starting a new business or changing to a better domain name, the tips above should help you pick out the best one for your business.</p>\n<p>Remember: As long as you have great content and a good SEO strategy, a strong and unique domain name may rank you higher. Choose one wisely, use it correctly and start reaping the value.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://semperplugins.com/choosing-the-right-domain-name-for-seo/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"0";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:48:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:39:"How to Come up with Great Content Ideas";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"https://semperplugins.com/how-to-come-up-with-great-content-ideas/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:75:"https://semperplugins.com/how-to-come-up-with-great-content-ideas/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 29 Aug 2017 13:00:30 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Blog";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"SEO Tips";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:17:"content marketing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:32:"http://semperplugins.com/?p=2375";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:423:"Do you spend hours staring at a blank computer screen or piece of paper, desperately racking your brain for just one great content idea?

Well, the sad reality is that you cannot afford to wait for inspiration to strike: your readers are waiting for yet another one of your great posts to enjoy and share.</p>\n<p>This article is your reference for tips and tricks to find inspiration and create great content to grow your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>We’ll cover the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How to source inspiration directly from your readers</li>\n<li>How to get great topic ideas from your social media channels</li>\n<li>Useful tools you may already be using, but not as effectively</li>\n<li>How to overcome writer&#8217;s block</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Know Your Readers and Their Concerns</h2>\n<p>This is arguably the starting point to creating great content: knowing your reader and their concerns.</p>\n<p>To gain and maintain a steady stream of followers, you must produce consistently good content that your blog visitors are interested in. Since your content is ideally centered around the needs and interests of your readers, it is therefore very important to know who they are.  But how would you know what your readers are interested in?</p>\n<p>First, put yourself in your reader&#8217;s shoes. Then ask and answer the following questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What issues do your readers struggle with most?</li>\n<li>What would better enable them to understand and solve those issues?</li>\n<li>What would a reader enter in search engines to find content in your niche?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Creating valuable content boils down to problem solving. You can start writing winning content more easily once you know what your readers are looking for and what their pain points are.</p>\n<p>A key thing to remember, however, is that some of your readers may be beginners who are trying to come to grips with your subject area. So create content that is clear &amp; appealing to beginners and which does not exclusively focus on advanced readers.</p>\n<h3>Look at Your Analytics</h3>\n<p>Your website analytics will provide you with a lot of insight regarding where your readers are coming from and how they&#8217;re interacting with your site. Check <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics</a> for keywords that users are searching for to get to your site, and then create engaging content about those topics.</p>\n<p>You can also use those insights to update and keep existing posts relevant; or to create new posts with detailed information on the problems your target audience is trying to solve.</p>\n<h3>Go Through Your Blog Comments</h3>\n<p>Your blog comments can be extremely helpful to you in a number of ways.</p>\n<p>First of all, they provide you with great insight into what readers think of the content you have written. This may include positive or negative feedback on the style and clarity of your writing, questions for more information on areas you can expand on, wide-spread problems being discussed and/or solutions to those problems.</p>\n<p>Note them down and come up with post ideas to help your readers.</p>\n<p>If your readers take the time to report a problem they are having, or to give you feedback, you need to listen. It usually means that it&#8217;s a significant challenge they, and other users, are facing.</p>\n<h3>Sift Through Your FAQs</h3>\n<p>You can actively engage with your readers by answering their most frequently asked questions in blog posts. This will show readers that you have carefully considered their responses to your content, and also helps other readers who may also have similar questions.</p>\n<p>And as a nice bonus, you may attract some more visitors that wouldn&#8217;t have found your WordPress site otherwise.</p>\n<h2>Use Social Media</h2>\n<p>Social media channels are arguably the best place to source inspiration. Take <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BuzzFeed</a> for example. They constantly browse the web for fun ideas &#8211; typically small trends or trending topics in niche areas &#8211; and make them more mainstream.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3026" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3026" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends.jpg" alt="At the time of writing, Twitter show us, for example, that growth hacking and content marketing tips are trending among bloggers." width="500" height="380" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends.jpg 754w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends-300x228.jpg 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends-328x250.jpg 328w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends-100x76.jpg 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends-150x114.jpg 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends-200x152.jpg 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends-450x343.jpg 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/twitter-trends-600x457.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">At the time of writing, Twitter show us that growth hacking and content marketing tips are now trending among bloggers.</p></div>\n<p>You can also use social media to stay on top of industry trends; and to monitor the new keywords created by these trends. Use tools like <a href="https://www.google.com/trends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Trends</a>, Twitter Trends, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit</a>, etc. to keep up with the conversation and take it to your blog.</p>\n<h2><b>Questionnaires </b>and Polls</h2>\n<p>Another useful way to engage with readers is to put out short surveys or polls on your blog, social media or your mailing list. Ask them any questions they may have or for their opinion on certain topics that you covered. This is also a fantastic way to keep them engaged with your content.</p>\n<p>Make it clear to your mailing list that you welcome questions. One way to do this is to offer some sort of incentive: perhaps a product discount, a coupon, or free mentoring to anyone who is willing to give a short interview. Interviewing in particular is a great way to find out a host of questions or issues your audience may have with your topic or industry that may never have even crossed your mind. This strategy may seem daunting, but is an effective way of coming up with content that is higher quality and more relevant to your audience.</p>\n<h2>Recycle and Transform</h2>\n<p>The fastest way for you to generate content ideas is by reading through existing content and expanding and improving on it. This means looking though what your competitors are writing about, and using that as a beacon to light your own blog posts. It is about taking already existing material, not copying it, but using it as a starting point for your own inspiration.</p>\n<p>An important thing to consistently keep in mind when expanding and improving existing material is to not limit yourself to the original piece; to consider what else readers would benefit from knowing. Perhaps you could make the piece more personal and relatable by referencing your personal experiences.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3639" style="width: 515px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3639" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot.png" alt="Using Feedly, you can quickly find out what your competitors are writing about and use their content as a source of inspiration for your own." width="505" height="369" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot.png 1280w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-300x219.png 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-768x561.png 768w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-1024x748.png 1024w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-342x250.png 342w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-100x73.png 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-150x110.png 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-200x146.png 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-450x329.png 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-600x438.png 600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/feedly-screenshot-900x657.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 505px) 100vw, 505px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Using Feedly, you can quickly find out what your competitors are writing about and use their content as a source of inspiration for your own.</p></div>\n<p>So how can you discover other content in your niche? Use tools such as <a href="https://feedly.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feedly</a> which shows you a list of publications that have been produced about a certain topic. Once you create an account, you can simply enter in specific keywords, URLs, or browse through existing categories.</p>\n<h2>Read Every Day</h2>\n<p>Reading every day actually means reading something relevant to your niche every single day. By doing so, you will find that over time, not only will your knowledge of the subject matter improve substantially, but that new sources of inspiration will spring up as well.</p>\n<p>Reading content written by others in your field and the comments left behind by their users is also a good way to find inspiration. When reading through other peoples content, you may notice that similar problems keep cropping up but have remained unanswered. You can subsequently try to answer those questions in depth and address those issues in your own blog.</p>\n<p>Visit popular blogs and websites, and observe the different ways in which they operate. Pay close attention to their writing style, and the topics that they are covering. You will slowly begin to pick up fresh ideas, and gain exposure to different viewpoints.</p>\n<p>Reading stimulates the brain, thus making it that much easier for you to generate great content ideas.</p>\n<h2>How to Tackle Writer’s Block</h2>\n<p>So you&#8217;ve found inspiration and are now struggling with writer&#8217;s block. One of the best techniques to overcome it is simply to write! Write something down every single day, no matter how small, or jumbled. The point is to get all your ideas down on paper, which you can later revise and expand on.</p>\n<p>Keep your work well organized, and easy to refer back to. You can use online note applications such as <a href="http://evernote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Evernote</a> or Google Docs to keep your work backed up and easily accessible.</p>\n<p>Having something to start with makes that blank page much less intimidating.</p>\n<h2>In a Nutshell</h2>\n<p>Once you get started using these tips and tricks, you will find that generating good content ideas is not as difficult as it may have initially seemed. So we hope this post has helped you to find inspiration for your next engaging blog post. The truth is, you really never know when your next source of inspiration may strike, so best of luck!</p>\n<p>Do you have any special tricks to come up with great content ideas?

We’ll show you how.</p>\n<p>First things first, let&#8217;s cover the basics of landing pages.</p>\n<h2>Why Should I Build a Landing Page?</h2>\n<p>Because they convert. A landing page is essentially the entry point to your site. A great landing page will <strong>grab a visitor’s attention and persuade them to take a desired action</strong>: perhaps you want them to sign up for your email list, download a brochure, buy a product, etc. Whatever the goal, a good landing page is always focused towards that goal.</p>\n<p>Just to make sure that you understand, let’s look at the difference between a landing page and the homepage of a site: <strong>a landing page is focused on a specific goal or objective</strong> while your main homepage has a broad objective. The aim of a landing page is to take your visitors through a specific marketing journey while the main homepage allows visitors to decide on their own journey through your site.</p>\n<p>Anyone can tell you that you don&#8217;t really need a landing page to get a visitor to take a specific action. You can actually make them take the desired action on your homepage.</p>\n<p>BUT, <strong>with a good landing page you will achieve a higher conversion rate</strong> because it is very specific in its goal. A homepage has a lot of information and elements that may distract a user from taking the desired action.</p>\n<p>So, are you ready to build one? Here are several ways to build landing pages in WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Building a Custom Page</h2>\n<p>Building a custom page within WordPress is the old-fashioned approach. You would simply just build a custom page template on any theme you have; and do whatever you need to in the template.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to build a custom page template in WordPress is to copy the default page PHP template and edit CSS and HTML components to get the desired design or structure.</p>\n<h2>Using Plugins to Build Landing Pages</h2>\n<p>Plugins are the best way to go if you do not want to worry about dealing with code.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there aren’t many free landing page builder plugins out there. And the few free ones often have in-plugin purchases or limited features. There is, however, one free plugin that has all the features you need to build a functional landing page in WordPress. It’s among the top landing page plugins (see below).</p>\n<h3>WordPress Landing Pages</h3>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/landing-pages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress Landing Pages</a> is an easy-to-use plugin that has <strong>all the basic features you need to build a functional landing page</strong>. It has a fair selection of templates, allows you to split test (a/b testing) your landing pages, as well as to track and measure conversions.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3482" style="width: 723px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3482" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages.png" alt="The WordPress Landing Pages plugin is fully integrated in the Theme Builder and allows you to quickly customize any elements you like." width="713" height="373" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages.png 1920w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-300x157.png 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-768x402.png 768w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-1024x537.png 1024w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-477x250.png 477w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-100x52.png 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-150x79.png 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-200x105.png 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-450x236.png 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-600x314.png 600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-900x472.png 900w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/wordpress-landing-pages-1200x630.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 713px) 100vw, 713px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">The WordPress Landing Pages plugin is fully integrated in the Theme Builder and allows you to quickly customize any elements you like.</p></div>\n<p>All in all, it is a good option if you are on a budget and don’t want to invest in a more functional landing page plugin at the moment.</p>\n<h3>Thrive Landing Pages</h3>\n<p><a href="https://thrivethemes.com/landingpages/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thrive Landing Pages</a> has a drag &amp; drop editor that makes it extremely easy to create and edit landing pages. It<strong> comes with over 140 templates</strong> (some themed) for you to choose from. The great thing about the plugin is that the landing pages are combined in sets to provide a consistent user experience. That means that the opt-in page, &#8220;thank you&#8221; page and confirmation pages in a particular set have the same feel and don’t provide random experiences.</p>\n<h3>Leadpages</h3>\n<p>Leadpages is actually an online landing page builder &#8211; we’ll be addressing it more thoroughly down below &#8211; with a plugin for WordPress. It has a centralized editor and your <strong>landing pages are hosted on Leadpages servers</strong>. The best thing about Leadpages is that you can easily and quickly create or publish a landing page. All you need to do is choose a template, customize it (through the drag &amp; drop page builder) and add it to your site.</p>\n<h3>Beaver Builder</h3>\n<p><a href="https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beaver Builder</a> is simply a drag &amp; drop page theme builder (another option covered below) that also comes as a plugin. You can easily and quickly create custom layouts and designs &#8211; you have around 30 landing pages to choose from.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3483" style="width: 734px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3483" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder.jpg" alt="You can try out the Beaver Builder plugin for yourself at http://demo.wpbeaverbuilder.com/." width="724" height="361" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder.jpg 1917w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-300x150.jpg 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-768x383.jpg 768w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-1024x511.jpg 1024w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-501x250.jpg 501w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-100x50.jpg 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-150x75.jpg 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-200x100.jpg 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-450x225.jpg 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-600x300.jpg 600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/beaver-builder-900x449.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 724px) 100vw, 724px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">You can try out the Beaver Builder plugin for yourself at <a href="http://demo.wpbeaverbuilder.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo.wpbeaverbuilder.com</a>.</p></div>\n<p>The great thing about Beaver Builder is that <strong>you can use your WordPress widgets to add more functionality</strong> and bring elements in from your site to your landing pages.</p>\n<h3>OptimizePress</h3>\n<p>You’ve probably heard of <a href="https://www.optimizepress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OptimizePress</a> before &#8211; it has been <strong>one of the most popular plugins</strong> to build landing pages for quite some time. That’s because it offers a wide range of templates and a powerful drag &amp; drop editor to quickly create the landing page you need. Note: the size of the plugin is quite large (29MB).</p>\n<h2>Theme Builders</h2>\n<p>As we mentioned earlier, <strong>most WordPress themes are quite restrictive when it comes to design and structure</strong>. For example, you can customize the primary content block of a page in most themes but you cannot amend the design of anything outside the block. So, if you aim to create a landing page from a theme page template, you would just end up with a new page with the same design as your website &#8211; the opposite of a landing page. Unless you build a custom page template (mentioned earlier) or use advanced theme builders.</p>\n<p>What advanced theme builders offer are drag and drop builders. They essentially enable you to customize every and any design aspect of any page. The interface is also very easy to use.<br />\nThere are plenty of great drag &amp; drop theme builders available.

If you already have HTTPS, this shouldn’t affect you. <strong>But if you’re still using HTTP, you’ll need to upgrade soon.</strong> The good news is that the transition is not as difficult as you think it is and the benefits outweigh the assumed disadvantages.</p>\n<p>This article will go over what the WordPress HTTPS mandate means for you as a site owner; the advantages; as well as how to upgrade to HTTPS if you haven’t already done so.</p>\n<h2>What is HTTPS?</h2>\n<p>HTTPS adds a security layer to HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). <strong>HTTPS essentially encrypts data</strong> (using SSL or TSL) that is communicated between servers and clients until it reaches the intended recipient.</p>\n<p>This<strong> prevents cybercriminals from accessing sensitive user information</strong> and also reduces the risk of tapping and modification of sensitive data. Although HTTPS is not completely foolproof, it undoubtedly has major security advantages.</p>\n<p>HTTPS sites can be easily identified, as they have a locked padlock icon located on the link bar in most common browsers.</p>\n<h2>Why is WordPress Pushing HTTPS?</h2>\n<p>There&#8217;s mainly two reasons for this, so let&#8217;s quickly dive into them.</p>\n<h3>Google Prefers It</h3>\n<p>It is no secret that greater encryption and cyber security has made the Internet a safer place for users. As usual, a Google update signaled the necessity of HTTPS for user experience, SEO and internet security.</p>\n<p>In 2014, Google suggested that <strong>enabling HTTPS on your site could result in higher search rankings</strong>. Although it still isn’t the only important factor in raising your site rankings, you shouldn’t underestimate its value. For example, if two sites are equal in all ways, but one site has HTTPS, that site would get a boost in rankings.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3342" style="width: 511px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3342" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock.png" alt="Chrome will display a green padlock in the link bar when a site is using HTTPS, assuring users it''s using the latest security protocol." width="501" height="217" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock.png 1138w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-300x130.png 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-768x333.png 768w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-1024x444.png 1024w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-577x250.png 577w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-100x43.png 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-150x65.png 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-200x87.png 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-450x195.png 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-600x260.png 600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-green-padlock-900x390.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 501px) 100vw, 501px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Chrome will display a green padlock in the link bar when a site is using HTTPS, assuring users it&#8217;s using the latest security protocol.</p></div>\n<p>In January of this year, Google released version 56 of Google Chrome. This new release brought about some changes, notably with how Google Chrome treats HTTPS vs. HTTP sites. The browser now clearly identifies sites that are not operating HTTPS on their systems. For example, <strong>a “Not Secure” message now appears on pages without HTTPS that try to collect passwords or sensitive information</strong>. You can expect that, eventually, all pages not using HTTPS will clearly be labeled as having insecure connections.</p>\n<p>We can reasonably assume that Google’s preference for HTTPS has been a contributing factor for the changes implemented by WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Users Prefer HTTPS Too</h3>\n<p>A secure connection can make all the difference from a user&#8217;s perspective. Users see HTTPS as a positive signal that you are taking your site security seriously, for their benefit. So, having <strong>HTTPS could mean more traffic and longer usage times</strong> on your site.</p>\n<p>HTTPS is particularly important if you are operating an e-commerce site. Simply seeing the padlock icon could make users more comfortable in entering their payment details and other personal information. Particularly with the new Chrome update (mentioned earlier) which shows a “Not Secure” label on e-commerce sites or sites that require a user login or credit card information, but don’t have HTTPS.</p>\n<p>Both Google and user preference should be enough reason for you to upgrade your site to HTTPS. It is simply necessary to ensure watertight security for your users and to protect your online business reputation.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3343" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-3343" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure.png" alt="Sites that require users to login or enter credit card information are now displayed as &quot;Not secure&quot; in Chrome when they haven''t switched to HTTPS yet." width="500" height="196" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure.png 1600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-300x118.png 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-768x301.png 768w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-1024x401.png 1024w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-638x250.png 638w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-100x39.png 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-150x59.png 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-200x78.png 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-450x176.png 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-600x235.png 600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/https-not-secure-900x353.png 900w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Sites that require users to login or enter credit card information are now displayed as &#8220;Not secure&#8221; in Chrome when they haven&#8217;t switched to HTTPS yet.</p></div>\n<p>Remember when JavaScript was first introduced and quickly embraced by users and webmasters? Looking back, we can see now that JavaScript was essential for smoother and better user experience. HTTPS similarly, presents a number of unique advantages for user experience and security that we should all quickly embrace.</p>\n<p>We know that you may be overwhelmed switching from HTTP to HTTPS. After all, change does takes time to get used to, but in this instance, you may need to quickly get on board. At this point, <strong>the advantages of HTTPS have greatly outnumbered the disadvantages</strong>. Plus, upgrading to HTTPS is no longer the costly, time consuming, and difficult process that it once was. In fact, getting an SSL certificate in 2017 is fast, sometimes free, and quite easy to implement.</p>\n<h2>How to Get HTTPS</h2>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/hosting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress hosting partners</a> should now provide an SSL certificate for all accounts. (It is required that they all do so as early as the first quarter of this year.)</p>\n<p>Your hosting provider may already provide a free SSL certificate, so check with them first before you make any third-party purchase. If they do not offer a free one, you could ask them if they sell third party SSL certificates. Once purchased, you can ask your provider to install the certificate for you on your server.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3344" style="width: 510px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-3344" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lets-encrypt-sponsors.png" alt="Dozens of major companies are already backing Lets Encrypt, including Automattic (known for WooCommerce, Jetpack, Akismet and WordPress.com)" width="500" height="395" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lets-encrypt-sponsors.png 546w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lets-encrypt-sponsors-300x237.png 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lets-encrypt-sponsors-317x250.png 317w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lets-encrypt-sponsors-100x79.png 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lets-encrypt-sponsors-150x118.png 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lets-encrypt-sponsors-200x158.png 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/lets-encrypt-sponsors-450x355.png 450w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Dozens of major companies are already backing Lets Encrypt, including Automattic (known for WooCommerce, Akismet and WordPress.com)</p></div>\n<p>Another option is to explore the free alternatives, independent of your hosting provider. There are projects such as “Let’s Encrypt” which have now made it easy and quick to <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">secure a free HTTPS certificate for your website</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s Encrypt is an authorized open Certificate Authority with millions of active certificates in place. There are other comparable projects out there that can help by guiding you step-by-step through the installation process or who have been authorized to deliver certificates.</p>\n<p>Remember that SSL certificates upgrade the website, but not the content itself. That means that the content on your page will also need to be updated so as to avoid 404 errors. Google may interpret the error as a mismatch in the security level of your site. The only way to avoid this is by encrypting the content of your website to match your SSL certificate.</p>\n<p>To track and resolve any 404 errors on your site, you may want to use a specialised plugin such as Redirection to do so.</p>\n<h2>What if You Just Don’t Want to Upgrade to HTTPS?</h2>\n<p>You could see a number of things happening to your site over time if you do not upgrade to HTTPS. The first may be facing the consequences set out by Google, i.e: <strong>lower rankings </strong>and having your users staring at a “Not Secure” warning when they try to access your site via Google Chrome.</p>\n<p>The second is that you could <strong>struggle with WordPress updates and lose some or all functionality</strong> on specific WordPress plugins.</p>\n<p>Third, your site may be <strong>an easier target for hacking</strong>.</p>\n<p>Those are three consequences that require you to seriously reconsider if you really want to take the risk of not upgrading to HTTPS.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>\n<p>Let’s put it this way: you will simply have nothing to lose by adopting HTTPS.

But a lot of businesses find it intimidating and challenging to use. If you’re one of those businesses, this article is for you.</p>\n<p>Although GA can be quite overwhelming, getting useful data to work with is not as difficult as you think it is. Understanding how to get some basic information from the platform can give you pretty good insight into how your website is working for your business.</p>\n<p>This article will give you a basic understanding of the four key sections that contain actionable data:</p>\n<p style="padding-left: 30px;">1. Audience<br />\n2. Behavior<br />\n3. Acquisition<br />\n4. Conversions</p>\n<p>Let’s get started.</p>\n<h2><strong>An Introduction to Google Analytics</strong></h2>\n<p>You probably have a Google Analytics account and most likely have it connected to your website. If you don’t, and you’re thinking of signing up, <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">use this guide on how to get started</a>. Once you’re up and running, you’ll have to wait a few days to get data to analyze.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll notice when you open the platform is GA’s (somewhat confusing) layout and menu system. It uses a top navigation for account level features and information; and a side navigation for combing through your analytics data.</p>\n<p>The Reporting section’s side navigation (which is where you can view your web analytics) is broken down into the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-Time:</strong> Shows what is happening on your site right now. So you’ll see the current visitor count on your website, what pages they’re browsing and for how long</li>\n<li><strong>Audience:</strong> Gives detailed information about your website visitors</li>\n<li><strong>Acquisition:</strong> Shows how your visitors are arriving to your site. It gives you a breakdown (by channel) of how visitors are getting to your site</li>\n<li><strong>Behavior:</strong> Shows you how visitors are interacting with your site</li>\n<li><strong>Conversions:</strong> Provides conversion data for your various business goals and activities</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, Audience, Acquisition, Behavior and Conversions tabs contain the <strong>actionable data you can use to optimize your site and grow your business.</strong></p>\n<p>So let’s help you get a basic understanding of those tabs.</p>\n<h2><strong>Audience</strong></h2>\n<p>To view your audience insights, click on Audience &gt; Overview on the left hand menu of the analytics dashboard.</p>\n<p>As you will see from the Audience Overview data, Google Analytics gives you detailed insights into your audience: from location, to page views to device type to language and more.</p>\n<p>This information is invaluable in allowing you to tailor your site<strong> to better suit the needs of your visitors and effectively grant them an easier viewing experience</strong>.</p>\n<p><a href="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3405" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="255" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section.jpg 1621w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-300x128.jpg 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-768x327.jpg 768w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-1024x436.jpg 1024w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-587x250.jpg 587w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-100x43.jpg 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-150x64.jpg 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-200x85.jpg 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-450x192.jpg 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-600x255.jpg 600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-audience-section-900x383.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>\n<p>There is however some terminology you first need to understand in order to accurately analyze your Audience data:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A <strong>Session</strong> refers to a single fixed period of time that a visitor takes action(s) on your site. So if a visitor views 3 pages on your site over a 3-minute period and then exits your site, it’ll be recorded as a single session and three pageviews</li>\n<li>As you may have gleaned from above, a <strong>Pageview</strong> is recorded whenever a visitor views a page on your site</li>\n<li>A <strong>New Visitor</strong> is any user that is visiting your site for the first time. They will be classified as a <strong>Returning Visitor</strong> on their second and subsequent visits</li>\n<li>A <strong>User</strong> is any computer or device that Google classifies as a unique visitor in accessing your site. So let’s say a user views your site on both their computer and tablet. Google will record that as two users. Even if a user accesses your site from two different browsers on the same computer, Google will record it as two users</li>\n<li><strong>Pages/Session</strong> is the average number of pageviews per session</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is recommended that you spend some time understanding these definitions before you begin analyzing the comprehensive audience data.</p>\n<h2><strong>Behavior</strong></h2>\n<p><a href="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3407" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="286" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section.jpg 1621w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-300x143.jpg 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-768x367.jpg 768w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-1024x489.jpg 1024w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-524x250.jpg 524w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-100x48.jpg 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-150x72.jpg 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-200x95.jpg 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-450x215.jpg 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-600x286.jpg 600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-behaviour-section-900x430.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>\n<p>The Behavior section gives you <strong>invaluable data on how your users are interacting with your site.</strong> You can track how long an average user stays on a specific page, the hours and days you receive the most traffic, bounce rates (the percentage of visitors who exit your site after viewing only one page), your site speed, and much more detailed and useful metrics.</p>\n<p>Spend some time exploring and familiarizing yourself with this section. It contains everything you need to know to optimize your site and user experience, and also to manage your blog or content pages.</p>\n<h2><strong>Acquisition</strong></h2>\n<p><a href="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3409" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="297" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section.jpg 1609w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-300x149.jpg 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-768x380.jpg 768w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-1024x507.jpg 1024w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-505x250.jpg 505w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-100x50.jpg 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-150x74.jpg 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-200x99.jpg 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-450x223.jpg 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-600x297.jpg 600w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/google-analytics-acquisition-section-900x446.jpg 900w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>\n<p>The Acquisition section is pretty straightforward: it contains <strong>data on how your site acquires traffic</strong>. It records the following traffic channels: organic (search and direct), paid, referral, email and social. It also gives you important insights into the performance of your marketing campaigns.</p>\n<p>What you should really be looking at within the Acquisition section is Goals. Goals are what you hope visitors accomplish when or after using your site. They are summarized in the Overview of this section but aren’t presented or broken down in detail. That’s where the Conversions section comes in.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conversions</strong></h2>\n<p>Conversion tracking is arguably the most important functionality in Google Analytics.

From BBS (Bulletin Board) to Friendster, Diaspora, Myspace and onto Facebook. But when we think of social media today, we arguably only have 3 or 4 large networks in mind: Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn.</p>\n<p>Nowadays, those four platforms have become essential to every marketer’s strategy and are used to effectively get your brand in front of your target audience; but do they <em>directly</em> impact your SEO and search ranking? No, they currently do not.</p>\n<p>However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that social media marketing and SEO do not affect each other in a variety of different ways. They are both inbound strategies that aim to attract your audience or customers to your brand. They are also both organic ways to attract your audience with unique quality content.</p>\n<p>Perhaps the best way to describe the relationship between SEO and social media is to say that they are co-dependent. Effective social media campaigns will help improve your site ranking, and good SEO will inevitably boost your social clout. This is what we refer to as social SEO: <strong>the use of social media to boost your search engine rankings</strong>.</p>\n<p>This post will demystify the relationship between social media and SEO; and show you how you can make social SEO work for your WordPress site.</p>\n<h2>How Important is Social SEO?</h2>\n<p>You can certainly rank your website well without focusing much on social SEO. You can’t, however, rank your website by focusing solely on social SEO. But that shouldn’t make you dismiss the whole idea too soon.</p>\n<p>An active and strong social media presence makes it easier and faster to rank your site as search engines attribute <strong>authority</strong> based on tweets, shares, likes and Google +1s. Your social media presence also puts your content in front of a larger audience, some of whom will link your content on their own sites, creating valuable organic <strong>backlinks</strong> which contribute to your PageRank.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3276" style="width: 630px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-3276" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/social-media-marketing-graph.png" alt="According to a recent study, Social Media Marketing even surpassed the impact of regular SEO in 2016, considering that market is already rather saturated.

Even though they have nothing on backlinks – and probably won’t, at least not in the near future – <strong>social links</strong> are still quite important. But <em>how much</em> effect or weight do they have on your rankings, particularly your ranking for target keywords?</p>\n<p>Well, search engines have not yet made that information public. We just have to work with the definitive information that social signals do (indirectly) impact your site rankings and will continue to do so.</p>\n<h2>When Should I Focus on Social SEO?</h2>\n<p>If you are in an industry where your competitors are heavily focusing on both SEO and social SEO, and you want to rank well for your industry keywords, you have no other option but to do the same. Backlinks coupled with social signals will boost your rankings much more than backlinks alone, so you will lag behind your competition if you are only focused on building the latter. And if they aren’t focused on social SEO, <strong>you should jump on the opportunity to get one step ahead of your competitors</strong>.</p>\n<p>Although social media does not directly impact your site rankings on Google, social networks are dominating the internet and will arguably dictate the future of the internet. You should invest properly in social media as it could soon <em>directly</em> impact your site’s rankings on search engines.</p>\n<h2>How to Effectively Implement Social SEO</h2>\n<p>How can you increase your site rankings with good social SEO? Here are a few summarized tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a business page on the “main” social networks: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Pinterest, Instagram, etc.</li>\n<li>Be active on those channels and engage your followers and subscribers</li>\n<li>Create shareable, engaging and unique content</li>\n<li>Make it as easy as possible for people to share your content</li>\n<li>Share your content, and that of other influencers in your field on your social channels</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The more active you are on social media, the more awareness you are bringing to your brand</strong>, the more your social following grows, and the higher the chance that your content is being shared across a broader network. It’s a snowball effect: the more followers you have, the more engagement you’ll get and the easier it will become to grow your community.</p>\n<p>A bigger community means that more people are viewing your content and the higher the chance that the content will be shared. This increases the number of backlinks to your site which will impact your search rankings for the better.</p>\n<p>Also, the more engagement you have on your social channels, the higher the chance that people will look for your brand on Google or other search engines via branded searches – which help your site rank for non-branded keywords that are relevant to your brand.</p>\n<p>You do have to consider that <strong>the above scenarios are based on the assumption that you are producing quality and unique content</strong>. If you are creating bad content, you won’t get anywhere. Users will not interact with your brand if you’re not offering them value or good entertainment. If you want your content shared and widely distributed, you need to put in the time to create quality and valuable content your audience will enjoy.</p>\n<p>In summary, the following social signals will increase your search engine rankings for the keywords you’re targeting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your social network followers</li>\n<li>The likes, shares, retweets, Google +1s your website gets</li>\n<li>Mentions by other authority or influencers in your field</li>\n<li>Positive reviews on your business’ Google+ page</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Using All in One SEO Pack for Social Meta</h2>\n<p><a href="https://semperplugins.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-pro-version/?loc=sp_navmenu">Our All in One SEO Pack plugin comes with a Social Meta module</a> to help you get going with social marketing. This feature allows you to add Open Graph meta tags to enrich your posts by creating a rich snippet. Let’s briefly go over how Open Graph meta tags work and how they specifically help you with social SEO.</p>\n<p>Basically, every web page on any site can be shared on social media channels. However, the way that shared page is displayed on social media may be very different. Websites that aren’t optimized with Open Graph meta tags won’t be as easily interpreted by Facebook, Twitter and the like and will, most of the time, show up as a blank link with a small description underneath.</p>\n<div id="attachment_3278" style="width: 516px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-3278" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/rich-social-snippet.png" alt="Would you be more inclined to click on a blank link or on a rich snippet such as this?" width="506" height="495" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Would you be more inclined to click on a blank link or on a rich snippet such as this?</p></div>\n<p>However, adding Open Graph meta tags to a page on your site enriches the snippet and enables Facebook and other social media networks to display your content in the way you want to present it when it is shared. This is where All in One SEO Pack comes into action. For a full overview of all Open Graph and social meta features, please visit our <a href="https://semperplugins.com/documentation/social-meta-module/">documentation section</a>.</p>\n<p>There is no concrete evidence that Open Graph meta tags are important for search engines, but they do enable you to create presentable good looking posts on social media (instead of a bland-looking post). This significantly increases your organic traffic from social media to your WordPress site. Studies have shown that <strong>traffic increases 100%-200% if a post looks great</strong> vs. a blank link that doesn’t really mean much to social media users.</p>\n<h2>Wrapping It Up</h2>\n<p>Overall, a solid social media strategy, in conjunction with good SEO practices, will increase organic traffic to your site. Solely focusing on SEO may not cut it any longer if you want to be a step ahead of your competition. Revising your strategy to incorporate social SEO will inevitably boost your organic traffic and could very well increase your search engine rankings in the near future.</p>\n<p>Do you currently have a social SEO strategy that’s working for you?

We all have at some point. After all, pageviews equals more ad revenue…right? Well, having a good email list is more valuable and can bring in more pageviews than you get using traditional methods.</p>\n<p>So how do you build an email list in WordPress?</p>\n<p>You always hear the same advice: create great content and people will subscribe, or have an opt-in form on your blog. Those methods are tried and tested but there are other more creative and effective ways to implement them and speed up the growth of your email list.</p>\n<p>We’re talking content upgrades, high-value opt-in forms and social proof.</p>\n<p>Let’s first start off with the basics before we dive into those three methods and how to effectively employ them.</p>\n<h2>The Basics</h2>\n<h3>What is an Email List?</h3>\n<p>An email list is a list of email addresses of your existing and prospective customers who have signed up or subscribed via your WordPress site to get updates, newsletters, special offers or announcements.</p>\n<h3>Why You Should Build an Email List</h3>\n<p>Email consistently outperforms social media across the board. It gets a higher view rate than Facebook or Twitter; 50-100 times the click rates of Facebook or Twitter; and is more cost-effective than any other marketing and social channel. Why? Because email is more intimate and private.</p>\n<p>If those stats haven’t convinced you yet, here are three other really good reasons:</p>\n<p><strong>#1.</strong> Your emails are guaranteed to reach the inboxes of each and every one of the active contacts on your email list. The email stays in their inbox until they take an action. Compare that to Facebook or Twitter, where your statuses and posts may not be seen by your followers because of algorithms and the inherent nature of those social networks. Bottom line: people check their emails more thoroughly than they do their social timelines</p>\n<p><strong>#2.</strong> Email is more secure and more flexible. You own your email list. You however, have very limited control and no ownership of your Twitter and Facebook account data. Furthermore, your social accounts could get hacked or suspended for whatever reason; or the platform could cease to exist or become less popular (think Myspace) etc. Whereas you own your email list and can communicate with your customers and prospects on your own terms.</p>\n<p><strong>#3.</strong> Email has more specific targeting. You can send information or announcements on product specific or geo-specific services to specific contacts that match some particular criteria.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that you should neglect your social networks. Social is great for user engagement so don’t give up on social just yet. Email will just bring you more visitors and conversions.</p>\n<p>So how can you get started today?</p>\n<p>Well, there are quite a few WordPress email marketing plugins at your disposal. Most of them require you to use them in conjunction with email marketing service providers and only help you to create signup forms on your site. They don’t go much further than that. A few however do. <a href="https://semperplugins.com/subscribe2-html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One of those is Subscribe2 HTML</a>.</p>\n<h2>Subscribe2 HTML</h2>\n<p>Subscribe2HTML plugin is arguably one of the most comprehensive and reliable email marketing plugins for WordPress. It gives you the option of sending emails on a per-post basis or periodically in a newsletter format.</p>\n<p>It manages your email lists in a straightforward way. For example, you don’t need to log in to compose an email every time before sending one. This comes in handy when you need to send out timely post updates – a great feature for high traffic blogs.</p>\n<p>There are two subscription options for Subscribe2 HTML: Registered Subscribers and Public Subscribers. Registered Subscribers are users who have subscribed to your blog and are consequently required to log-in to your site to manage their subscriptions. They can opt to receive either plain text or HTML emails. You can send them post notifications by category; and they can choose whether they want just the excerpt or the full post. (If they don’t make a choice, they will get the full post when they select the plain text option).</p>\n<div id="attachment_3261" style="width: 391px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class=" wp-image-3261" src="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2.png" alt="Suscribe2HTML is full of features and can be configured in any way you like." width="381" height="462" srcset="https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2.png 610w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2-248x300.png 248w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2-206x250.png 206w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2-100x121.png 100w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2-150x182.png 150w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2-200x242.png 200w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2-300x363.png 300w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2-450x545.png 450w, https://semperplugins.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/subscribe2-600x727.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 381px) 100vw, 381px" /><p class="wp-caption-text">Suscribe2HTML is full of features and can be configured in any way you like.</p></div>\n<p>Public Subscribers can sign up through an online form. However, their subscription only starts when they confirm the subscription request via email. They do not get to choose between an excerpt or plain text version of an email.</p>\n<p>As an admin, you can subscribe or unsubscribe users and send emails to all verified subscribers. You also have a selection of email templates to choose from.</p>\n<p>There are additional options and settings available, like choosing the frequency of your emails and the time of day to send them. The plugin is all about automation to save you valuable time.</p>\n<h2>3 Effective strategies to Grow Your Email List</h2>\n<h3>Content</h3>\n<p>Consistently creating great content is the advice you always hear and read about when looking for ways to increase traffic to your blog and to grow your email list. That’s all good and true, but have you heard of a content upgrade? It’s a simple and highly effective strategy to grow your email list.</p>\n<p>How it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Write an engaging blog post.</li>\n<li>Create a more in-depth version of the post.</li>\n<li>Give readers the option to read the upgraded content in return for their email address.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This strategy works on the basis that your readers are already interested in the blog post since they clicked on it. So, a content upgrade plays on that interest by offering more. It’s simple, straightforward and highly effective.</p>\n<h3>Opt-In Forms</h3>\n<p>Like you’ve heard over and over again (and seen on many high-traffic sites), opt-in forms are the way to go when growing your email list. It’s worth mentioning again in this post. Whether you’re offering an eBook, white paper or free software, opt-in forms will increase your email subscriptions.</p>\n<p>The key is not to offer as many incentives as you can. The most efficient strategy is to pick a high-value incentive and place it in appropriate areas of your site (the sidebar, pop-ups, blog post, footer, etc.). This strategy is especially great for small businesses that don’t have the time or the manpower to produce upgraded content for every blog post.</p>\n<h3>Social Proof</h3>\n<p>A majority of online users rely on ratings, popularity and reviews in making purchasing decisions. Social proof is very important and shouldn’t be underestimated.</p>\n<p>That being said, you should focus on your numbers. Add up all your followers and subscribers on all channels and put the total out there. The bigger the number, the more impressive.</p>\n<p>In fact, various research studies have shown that social proof has more impact on behavior than financial, environmental and personal incentives.</p>\n<p>Would you also like to be included in our email list?

Have you been complaining about it since time immemorial? Well, then your WordPress site might be as bloated as you were after that marvelous Thanksgiving dinner at your mom’s. If your site has been live for a while now, <strong>chances are that its database has acquired quite a bit of garbage and is demanding a spring clean</strong>.</p>\n<p>The trick to maintaining a database is to clean it regularly to prevent the accumulation of unnecessary data. However, we are guessing that you have been skimping on the cleaning bit, which is why you are here today. Therefore, without wasting time, we will tell you how to clean up that database in a few easy steps.</p>\n<h2><strong>#1. Basic Ground Rules</strong></h2>\n<p>Before you take on the massive task of spring-cleaning, you must ensure that your valuables are safe and sound. Losing a single system file can mess up your website entirely and can cause you to lose thousands of dollars in revenue.</p>\n<p>So start by creating copies of important files and create a backup of your entire website. You should definitely<a href="https://ithemes.com/purchase/backupbuddy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> check out Backupbuddy from our friends at iThemes</a>. It&#8217;s a great plugin that allows you to schedule automatic full or database-only backups, and we highly recommend it.</p>\n<h2><strong>#2. Screen Through the Clutter</strong></h2>\n<p>Do you remember how yard sales used to work before Craigslist and eBay came along? Just like separating the valuables from trash, you need to pick out the plugins you use and the ones you don’t.</p>\n<p>You can easily get started by going through your complete list of plugins in your WordPress dashboard. Go to your admin panel and click on Plugins. Next, go to Installed Plugins and click on Inactive at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Eliminating unused plugins should easily free up a couple of bytes and is the first step towards cleaning up your WordPress database.</p>\n<h2><strong>#3. Time For a Purge </strong></h2>\n<p>This might sound very ominous (esp. to the ones familiar with the popular movie franchise), but it is the best way to free up space. After deleting all unused plugins you should start cleaning out post data.</p>\n<p>If you have been using WordPress from a while, you might not be as surprised to know that all your post data is being stored in your website database. You can find it all in the wp_postmeta table, and you can run this query to get rid of all superfluous data:</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_postmeta WHERE meta_key = &#8216;your-meta-key</p></blockquote>\n<p>Always remember to replace the last part with the value that has to be cleared out.</p>\n<h2>#4. <strong>Take Care of Spam</strong></h2>\n<p>Spam is no longer restricted to your inbox. If you look through your database carefully, you will find tons of spam comments as well. These include promotional features and unscrupulous backlinks that other sites use to eat their way into your SEO. Monitoring comments is an essential practice that is currently underrated.</p>\n<p>The easiest way to manage spam comments on your site is to execute this query:</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = &#8216;spam&#8217;;</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are currently <a href="https://semperplugins.com/wordpress-multisite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using a multi-site installation of WordPress</a>, you may like to try the following query:</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_#_comments WHERE comment_approved = &#8216;spam&#8217;;</p></blockquote>\n<h2>#5. <strong>What About Comments Waiting on Moderation?</strong></h2>\n<p>As a WordPress website/blog admin, you have the power to delete all comments that are awaiting moderation. This eliminates the need of unnecessarily going through each and every spam comment that you haven’t yet moderated.</p>\n<p>Just a word of advice: go through the list once to approve all genuine comments before running this query:</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_approved = &#8216;0&#8217;;</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>#6. Taking Care of Unused Tags</strong></h2>\n<p>This has happened to almost all of us. When we were new at blogging, we created a few hundred tags thinking we would use them from time to time. And now that we post regularly, we hardly ever change tags. We use the most common ones and stick to those.</p>\n<p>Don’t be surprised if you have completely forgotten about a score of tags that you exist on your website database (thanks to your wild imaginative powers). Fortunately, we have a query that will take care of all unused tags, but be sure to check the ones that you do use before running this query:</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_terms wt<br />\nINNER JOIN wp_term taxonomy wtt ON wt.term_id = wtt.term_id WHERE wtt.taxonomy = &#8216;post_tag&#8217; and wtt.count = 0;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Check out some of our earlier posts if you are unsure about <a href="https://semperplugins.com/categories-and-tags/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the differences between categories &amp; tags and how to use them</a>.</p>\n<h2>#7. <strong>Bid Farewell to Pingbacks</strong></h2>\n<p>If you are currently using a setting that has turned off the option of accepting pingbacks, then you may want to use the following code. This will remove every pingback ever made to your website from your database.</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_type = &#8216;pingback&#8217;;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Again, if you are currently <a href="https://semperplugins.com/wordpress-multisite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">using a multisite installation</a>, you may try using the next one. just remember to replace # with your current site id.</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_#_comments WHERE comment_type = &#8216;pingback&#8217;;</p></blockquote>\n<h2><strong>#8. No more Post Revisions</strong></h2>\n<p>Post revisions are indeed necessary for blogs, but once you see the space they take up on your database, you won’t think twice about bidding them farewell. They grow fast and exponentially. You can clear them out at one go using the next query:</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE a, b, c FROM wp_posts a LEFT JOIN wp_term_relationships b ON (a.ID = b.object_id)<br />\nLEFT JOIN wp_postmeta c ON (a.ID = c.post_id) WHERE a.post_type = &#8216;revision&#8217;</p></blockquote>\n<p>You can even chose to disable all post revisions for your website using the following SQL code:</p>\n<blockquote><p>define(&#8216;WP_POST_REVISIONS&#8217;), false);</p></blockquote>\n<h2>#9. Getting Rid of Trackbacks</h2>\n<p>Your final step should be getting rid of all old trackbacks. To make sure that nothing goes wrong, double check so that all your pingbacks and trackbacks have been disabled before trying the next SQL code:</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_comments WHERE comment_type = &#8216;trackback&#8217;;</p></blockquote>\n<p>For multisite users, the next query should be more profitable. You can use this one to clean out all your trackbacks at one go. Like previous ones, replace # with your current site ID to remove all of your site&#8217;s trackbacks.</p>\n<blockquote><p>DELETE FROM wp_#_comments WHERE comment_type = &#8216;trackback&#8217;;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Besides these, you can also scrap your old posts once your audience has fallen out of love with them. This might be difficult at first, but many old posts are nothing but unwarranted burden for WordPress databases.</p>\n<p>If you are new and quite lost with the new set of codes, queries and rules we were talking about right here, leave your maintenance <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to seasoned plugins like Optimize</a>. They work great with multisite installations as well, and include extensive options for managing and removing unused tables.</p>\n<p>This article has been written by Derek Iwasiuk from <a href="https://engagethecrowd.com/minneapolis-seo-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.engagethecrowd.com</a>.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"https://semperplugins.com/how-to-clean-your-wordpress-database/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"18";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:51:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:5:{s:0:"";a:7:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:53:"A Glance at the Past &amp; Future of Keyword Research";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:62:"https://semperplugins.com/past-and-future-of-keyword-research/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://semperplugins.com/past-and-future-of-keyword-research/#comments";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 07 Mar 2017 11:27:03 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:4:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Blog";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:16:"keyword research";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"semantic search";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:11:"user intent";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://semperplugins.com/?p=3155/";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:424:"While getting started on a brand new SEO campaign, often the first thing you would be doing is keyword research.

It is supposed to provide the much-needed skeletal framework for your campaign and has proven to be a vital technique for a long time now. However, during the last few years, keyword research has changed dramatically, it has experienced fascinating evolutions and has somewhat become less relevant in more ways than one.</p>\n<h2><strong>Why Is Keyword Research Important?</strong></h2>\n<p>Keyword research is essential to ensure that your content satisfies inbound visitors and that all incoming queries are directly related to your business.</p>\n<p>You can find out which queries offer low competition, allowing you to selectively target vital keywords and phrases to include in your site’s content. Identifying keywords and keeping track of them serves as an important metric that you can utilize to gauge your campaign’s effectiveness, by keeping track of rankings over a period of time.</p>\n<h2><strong>Back In Time</strong></h2>\n<p>In the past, SEO seemed to be really simple. You stuffed your keywords all over your page&#8217;s content, into each and every meta tag, and prayed for the best.</p>\n<p>With the help of Google Analytics, Google offered lots of data about how individuals were searching, and exactly how they came across your site through keywords. Moreover, once you had access to a list of keywords which ensured low competition but high traffic, you could at once start optimizing your content to target those queries.</p>\n<p>Most Google searches would feature one-to-one relationships. During those days, Google would take your words and find near exact matches on the web.</p>\n<h2><strong>What&#8217;s that, Hummingbird?</strong></h2>\n<p>In 2013, Google launched its Hummingbird algorithm update.</p>\n<p>This update presented a whole new concept called &#8216;semantic search&#8217; that revolutionized the way Google handles queries. Instead of taking the user’s words and looking for appropriate matches online, Google evaluates the intention that is behind a user’s query and then determines which content is relevant.</p>\n<p>Even though it looks like an insignificant difference, in reality, it has a great impact on the way we should perceive keywords. The faster that semantic search evolved, the more power that individual keywords lost, giving way to long-tail keywords and topical themes.</p>\n<h2><strong>Forecasting the Future</strong></h2>\n<p><a href="https://semperplugins.com/keyword-research-trends-that-matter-in-2017/">In our recent post on keyword research trends</a>, we discussed how new technologies drastically impact the manner in which searches are conducted. Digital assistants such as Cortana and Siri are motivating users to perform searches through speech and are fundamentally changing the way queries are entered.</p>\n<p>Other innovations such as augmented reality, wearables, and virtual reality could be having the same and complementary effect, by compelling users to alter the manner in which they search. New kinds of interfaces and (even) smaller screens will soon be changing the way we interact with search engines.</p>\n<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>\n<p>Keyword research is bound to change and will not remain in its present form forever. We will be witnessing an iterative and gradual transition to a whole new search research system that is based specifically on the latest technologies and current search trends. You better prepare yourself mentally for a few drastic changes during the next decade.</p>\n<p>This article has been written by Walter Moore from <a href="https://www.gingerdomain.com/">gingerdomain.com</a>.</p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:67:"https://semperplugins.com/past-and-future-of-keyword-research/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"9";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}s:27:"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom";a:1:{s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:3:{s:4:"href";s:31:"https://semperplugins.com/feed/";s:3:"rel";s:4:"self";s:4:"type";s:19:"application/rss+xml";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:44:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/";a:2:{s:12:"updatePeriod";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6:"hourly";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:15:"updateFrequency";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1:"1";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";O:42:"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary":1:{s:7:"\0*\0data";a:18:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 05:28:06 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:34:"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8";s:14:"content-length";s:5:"30657";s:7:"expires";s:29:"Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT";s:13:"cache-control";s:35:"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate";s:6:"pragma";s:8:"no-cache";s:3:"p3p";s:69:"CP="IDC DSP COR ADM DEVi TAIi PSA PSD IVAi IVDi CONi HIS OUR IND CNT"";s:12:"x-robots-tag";s:15:"noindex, follow";s:4:"link";s:62:"<https://semperplugins.com/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"";s:17:"x-tec-api-version";s:2:"v1";s:14:"x-tec-api-root";s:50:"https://semperplugins.com/wp-json/tribe/events/v1/";s:16:"x-tec-api-origin";s:25:"https://semperplugins.com";s:10:"set-cookie";a:6:{i:0;s:44:"PHPSESSID=u1vd0pjnkdv5dc81smj71cm640; path=/";i:1;s:120:"wpml_referer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsemperplugins.com%2Ffeed%2F; expires=Fri, 15-Sep-2017 05:28:06 GMT; Max-Age=86400; path=/";i:2;s:86:"_icl_current_language=en; expires=Fri, 15-Sep-2017 05:28:06 GMT; Max-Age=86400; path=/";i:3;s:70:"Cart66DBSID=2VXH9OM0452KA8C2CJV97HWF9QTM8JW22ZRAOWXU; path=/; HttpOnly";i:4;s:107:"wfvt_986099475=59ba1366228ae; expires=Thu, 14-Sep-2017 05:58:06 GMT; Max-Age=1800; path=/; secure; HttpOnly";i:5;s:86:"_icl_current_language=en; expires=Fri, 15-Sep-2017 05:28:06 GMT; Max-Age=86400; path=/";}s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 17:30:09 GMT";s:4:"etag";s:39:""4bc39db72d3427dacb8dcd6b478a25ab-gzip"";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:16:"content-encoding";s:4:"gzip";}}s:5:"build";s:14:"20130911040210";}', 'no');

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">submit it here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></i></p>\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:30:"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1";a:1:{s:7:"post-id";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:33:"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n\n		\n		\n				\n			";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:35:"WordPress 4.8.1 Maintenance Release";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/wordpress-4-8-1-maintenance-release/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 02 Aug 2017 21:26:25 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8:"Releases";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4875";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:366:"After over 13 million downloads of WordPress 4.8, we are pleased to announce the immediate availability of WordPress 4.8.1, a maintenance release.

Read on for more interesting news from around the WordPress world in July.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Weekly meeting for new core contributors</h2>\n<p>Onboarding new contributors is a persistent issue for most WordPress contribution teams. While every team welcomes any new contributors, the path to getting deeply involved can be tricky to find at times.</p>\n<p>This month, the Core team implemented a fantastic new initiative: <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/06/30/announcing-a-weekly-new-contributors-meeting/">weekly meetings for new core contributors</a> as a way to encourage involvement and foster fresh contributions. The meetings not only focus on bugs suited to first-time contributors, they also make space for experienced contributors to help out individuals who may be new to developing WordPress core.</p>\n<p>The meetings are held every Wednesday at 19:00 UTC in the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Increased focus on PHP practices in WordPress core</h2>\n<p>In bringing people together to improve WordPress core, a new channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> named #core-php is designed to focus on PHP development in the project.</p>\n<p>Along with this increased concentration on PHP, a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/07/06/announcement-for-weekly-php-meetings/">new weekly meeting is now taking place</a> every Monday at 18:00 UTC in #core-php to improve WordPress core’s PHP practices.</p>\n<h2>Sharp rise in meetup group growth</h2>\n<p>The dashboard events widget in WordPress 4.8 displays local, upcoming WordPress events for the logged in user. The events listed in this widget are pulled from the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">meetup chapter program</a>, as well as the <a href="https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule">WordCamp schedule</a>.</p>\n<p>This widget provides greater visibility of official WordPress events, and encourages community involvement in these events. It’s safe to say that the widget has achieved its goals admirably — since WordPress 4.8 was released a little over a month ago, 31 new meetup groups have been formed with 15,647 new members across the whole program. This is compared to 19 new groups and only 7,071 new members in the same time period last year.</p>\n<p>You can find a local meetup group to join <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">on meetup.com</a>, and if you would like to get involved in organizing events for your community, you can find out more about the inner workings of the program <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/meetups/">on the Community Team site</a> or by joining the #community-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.1 due for imminent release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.8 cycle’s first maintenance release will be published in the coming week, more than a month after 4.8 was released. This release fix some important issues in WordPress core and the majority of users will find that their sites will update to this new version automatically.</p>\n<p>If you would like to help out by testing this release before it goes live, you can follow the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta/">beta testing guide</a> for WordPress core.

Read on to hear more about these as well as other interesting stories from around the WordPress world.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>WordPress 4.8</h2>\n<p>On June 8, a week before the Community Summit and WordCamp Europe,<a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/"> WordPress 4.8 was released</a>.You can read<a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/wordpress-4-8-field-guide/"> the Field Guide</a> for a comprehensive overview of all the features of this release (the News and Events widget in the dashboard is one of the major highlights).</p>\n<p>Most people would either have their version auto-updated, or their hosts would have updated it for them. For the rest, the updates have gone smoothly with no major issues reported so far.</p>\n<p>This WordPress release saw contributions from 346 individuals; you can find their names in <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/06/evans/">the announcement post</a>. To get involved in building WordPress core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2017</h2>\n<p><a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe 2017</a> was held in Paris between June 15-17. The event began with a Contributor Day, followed by two days of talks and community goodness. The talks were live-streamed, but you can still catch all the recordings <a href="http://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-europe-2017/">on WordPress.tv</a>. The organisers also published <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/30/wordcamp-europe-2017-in-paris-its-a-wrap/">a handy wrap-up of the event</a>.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe exists to bring together the WordPress community from all over the continent, as well as to inspire local communities everywhere to get their own events going — to that end, the event was a great success, as a host of new meetup groups have popped up in the weeks following WordCamp Europe.</p>\n<p>The work that Contributor Day participants accomplished was both varied and valuable, covering all aspects of the WordPress project — have a look through <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/">the Make blogs</a> for updates from each team.</p>\n<p>Finally, we also learned during the event that <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/2017/06/17/belgrade-serbia-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2018/">WordCamp Europe 2018 will be held in Belgrade, Serbia</a>, continuing the tradition of exploring locations and communities across the continent.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Community Summit</h2>\n<p>The fourth WordPress Community Summit took place during the two days leading up to WordCamp Europe 2017. This event is an invite-only unconference where people from all over the WordPress community come together to discuss some of the more difficult issues in the community, as well as to make plans for the year ahead in each of the contribution teams.</p>\n<p>As the Summit is designed to be a safe space for all attendees, the notes from each discussion are in the process of being anonymized before we publish them on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/">the Summit blog</a> (so stay tuned &#8211; they’ll show up there over the next few weeks).</p>\n<p>You can already see the final list of topics that were proposed for the event <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/summit/2017/06/10/community-summit-2017-final-list-of-topic/">here</a> (although a few more were added during the course of the two day Summit).</p>\n<h2>WordPress marketing push continues apace</h2>\n<p>As part of the push to be more intentional in marketing WordPress (as per Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2016/12/07/matt-mullenweg-state-of-the-word-2016/">2016 State of the Word</a>), the Marketing team has launched two significant drives to obtain more information about who uses WordPress and how that information can shape their outreach and messaging efforts.</p>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/2017/06/15/wordpress-case-studies-and-usage-survey/">The team is looking for WordPress case studies</a> and is asking users, agencies, and freelancers to take a WordPress usage survey. This will go a long way towards establishing a marketing base for WordPress as a platform and as a community — and many people in the community are looking forward to seeing this area develop further.</p>\n<p>To get involved in the WordPress Marketing team, you can visit <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/">their team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Gutenberg editor available for testing</h2>\n<p>For some time now, the Core team has been hard at work on a brand-new text editor for WordPress — this project has been dubbed “Gutenberg.” The project’s ultimate goal is to replace the existing TinyMCE editor, but for now it is in beta and available for public testing — <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">you can download it here as a plugin</a> and install it on any WordPress site.</p>\n<p>This feature is still in beta, so we don’t recommend using it on a production site. If you test it out, though, you’ll find that it is a wholly different experience to what you are used to in WordPress. It’s a more streamlined, altogether cleaner approach to the text-editing experience than we’ve had before, and something that many people are understandably excited about. Matt Mullenweg discussed the purpose of Gutenberg in more detail during <a href="http://wordpress.tv/2017/07/01/interview-and-qanda-with-matt-mullenweg/">his Q&amp;A at WordCamp Europe</a>.</p>\n<p>There are already a few reviews out from <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/gutenberg-wordpress-editor/">Brian Jackson at Kinsta</a>, <a href="https://daily.jorb.in/2017/06/random-thoughts-on-gutenberg/">Aaron Jorbin</a>, and <a href="https://www.mattcromwell.com/gutenberg-first-impressions/">Matt Cromwell</a> (among many others). Keep in mind that the project is in constant evolution at this stage; when it eventually lands in WordPress core (probably in v5.0), it could look very different from its current iteration — that’s what makes this beta stage and user testing so important.</p>\n<p>To get involved with shaping the future of Gutenberg, please <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">test it out</a>, and join the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.

Simply insert your image right within the widget settings. Try adding something like a headshot or a photo of your latest weekend adventure — and see it appear automatically.</p>\n<h3>Video Widget</h3>\n<p>A welcome video is a great way to humanize the branding of your website. You can now add any video from the Media Library to a sidebar on your site with the new Video widget. Use this to showcase a welcome video to introduce visitors to your site or promote your latest and greatest content.</p>\n<h3>Audio Widget</h3>\n<p>Are you a podcaster, musician, or avid blogger? Adding a widget with your audio file has never been easier. Upload your audio file to the Media Library, go to the widget settings, select your file, and you’re ready for listeners. This would be a easy way to add a more personal welcome message, too!</p>\n<h3>Rich Text Widget</h3>\n<p>This feature deserves a parade down the center of town! Rich-text editing capabilities are now native for Text widgets. Add a widget anywhere and format away. Create lists, add emphasis, and quickly and easily insert links. Have fun with your newfound formatting powers, and watch what you can accomplish in a short amount of time.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Link Boundaries</h2>\n<div id="v-8BDWH3QG-1" class="video-player"><video id="v-8BDWH3QG-1-video" width="632" height="342" poster="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg" controls="true" preload="metadata" dir="ltr" lang="en"><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.64001E, mp4a.40.2&quot;" /><source src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_fmt1.ogv" type="video/ogg; codecs=&quot;theora, vorbis&quot;" /><div><img alt="Link Boundaries" src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/8BDWH3QG/3-link-boundaries_dvd.original.jpg?resize=632%2C342" data-recalc-dims="1" /></div><p>Link Boundaries</p></video></div>\n<p>Have you ever tried updating a link, or the text around a link, and found you can&#8217;t seem to edit it correctly? When you edit the text after the link, your new text also ends up linked. Or you edit the text in the link, but your text ends up outside of it. This can be frustrating! With link boundaries, a great new feature, the process is streamlined and your links will work well. You’ll be happier. We promise.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">Nearby WordPress Events</h2>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-4779 size-large" src="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=632%2C465&#038;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=1024%2C753&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=300%2C221&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?resize=768%2C565&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2017/06/events-widget.png?w=1126&amp;ssl=1 1126w" sizes="(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px" data-recalc-dims="1" /></p>\n<p>Did you know that WordPress has a thriving offline community with groups meeting regularly in more than 400 cities around the world?

Files will still display as a download link, but will no longer be embedded automatically.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/22/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-8/">Multisite Updates</a></h3>\n<p>New capabilities have been introduced to 4.8 with an eye towards removing calls to<br />\n<code>is_super_admin()</code>. Additionally, new hooks and tweaks to more granularly control site and user counts per network have been added.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/23/addition-of-tinymce-to-the-text-widget/">Text-Editor JavaScript API</a></h3>\n<p>With the addition of TinyMCE to the text widget in 4.8 comes a new JavaScript API for instantiating the editor after page load. This can be used to add an editor instance to any text area, and customize it with buttons and functions. Great for plugin authors!</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/26/media-widgets-for-images-video-and-audio/">Media Widgets API</a></h3>\n<p>The introduction of a new base media widget REST API schema to 4.8 opens up possibilities for even more media widgets (like galleries or playlists) in the future. The three new media widgets are powered by a shared base class that covers most of the interactions with the media modal. That class also makes it easier to create new media widgets and paves the way for more to come.</p>\n<h3><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/05/16/customizer-sidebar-width-is-now-variable/">Customizer Width Variable</a></h3>\n<p>Rejoice! New responsive breakpoints have been added to the customizer sidebar to make it wider on high-resolution screens. Customizer controls should use percentage-based widths instead of pixels.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2 style="text-align: center">The Squad</h2>\n<p>This release was led by <a href="https://matt.blog">Matt</a> and <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/jbpaul17">Jeff Paul</a>, with the help of the following fabulous folks.

WordPress developers have created <a href="https://atom.io/packages/search?q=WordPress" target="_blank">more than a dozen packages</a> that support actions and filters, WP-CLI commands, documentation, and snippets for third-party plugins.</p>\n<p>Those who have adopted Atom appreciate its extendability, but the most common complaint from the Atom community is that the code editor is noticeably <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/why-is-atom-so-slow/11376/193" target="_blank">slower than many others</a>. This has been a frequent <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-is-painfully-slow/36298" target="_blank">topic</a> of <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8989606" target="_blank">discussion</a> for several years and its creators admit that <a href="https://discuss.atom.io/t/atom-feels-slow-or-is-consuming-too-much-cpu-or-memory/32662?source_topic_id=36298" target="_blank">performance isn&#8217;t one of its strongest features</a>. However, sometimes extreme performance issues can be caused by a package that a user has installed.</p>\n<p>Atom partnered with Facebook&#8217;s <a href="https://nuclide.io/" target="_blank">Nuclide</a> project developers to develop the new <a href="https://atom.io/packages/atom-ide-ui" target="_blank">Atom IDE UI</a> package that uses Atom’s <a href="https://github.com/atom/atom-languageclient" target="_blank">atom-languageclient</a> library in displaying features supported by the <a href="http://langserver.org/" target="_blank">language server protocol</a>. Users who want to get started with Atom-IDE will need to install the Atom IDE UI package as well as an IDE language support package (i.e. <a href="https://atom.io/packages/ide-php" target="_blank">ide-php</a>).</p>\n<p>Using Atom-IDE currently requires Atom Beta 1.21+. In the future the team plans to add support for more languages, which will most likely happen through outside package contributions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the help of our community, we plan to expand the number of languages that Atom-IDE can support and make it possible for you to run and edit applications, making Atom-IDE a true IDE,&#8221; Damien Guard said. &#8220;We hope to see future language support for the great languages out there including Rust, Go, Python, etc.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 14 Sep 2017 02:12:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"WPTavern: Display Widgets Plugin Permanently Removed from WordPress.org Due to Malicious Code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74768";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"https://wptavern.com/display-widgets-plugin-permanently-removed-from-wordpress-org-due-to-malicious-code";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6033:"<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-widgets/" target="_blank">Display Widgets</a>, a plugin with more than 200,000 active installs, has been removed from WordPress.org due to its authors inserting malicious code. SEO consultant <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-law-9444b637/" target="_blank">David Law</a> was the first to bring this issue to the attention of the plugin team after discovering that Display Widgets was inserting content into sites from external servers and also collecting visitor data without permission. He posted to the WordPress.org forums <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-plugin-v2-6-1-deleted-from-the-plugin-repository/" target="_blank">several</a> <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-plugin-v2-6-3-1-includes-hacking-code/" target="_blank">times</a> to warn other users.</p>\n<p>Wordfence has been warning its customers about the plugin during the past several months and published a <a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2017/09/display-widgets-malware/" target="_blank">timeline</a> tracking how Display Widgets was removed from WordPress.org on four separate occasions. According to their independent investigation, the plugin included a backdoor that allowed the plugin author to publish spam content to the sites where Display Widgets is installed. It also prevented logged-in users from being able to see the content.</p>\n<p><a href="https://pagely.com/blog/2017/09/malicious-code-display-widgets/" target="_blank">Pagely banned the Display Widgets plugin</a> from its hosting platform this week:</p>\n<blockquote><p>For our customer’s safety, we have banned the plugin from our customer sites&#8230;The plugin will remained banned on our network until a time that we see someone has taken responsibility for the plugin and the future of patching its code.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets had recently changed hands, as it was acquired from the team that created Formidable Forms. The previous owners have issued a warning about the plugin on Twitter, advising users to remove it from their sites.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">We don''t have a way of contacting users of our old Display Widgets plugin.

They do not receive a notice in the WordPress admin about the plugin having been removed from the directory. Since Display Widgets was a fairly popular plugin, there are likely many sites that still have it active and those website owners are probably unaware of the spam content they are publishing.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the plugin team issued a notice that <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/display-widgets-2-7-is-safe/" target="_blank">Display Widgets 2.7 is a clean version</a> that restores the plugin to version 2.0.5 before the malicious code was added:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We will be leaving this version deploying updates, however at this time we will NOT be allowing for its adoption. The second owner has effectively destroyed any trust a person might have in the plugin.</p>\n<p>Note: You CANNOT visit the page or download it as a new plugin for a reason. This plugin is done. It’s not supported, it’s not worked on, nothing. So if you have it, upgrade. Otherwise, find something else to use.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Display Widgets is now likely to end up in the graveyard of abandoned plugins, but there are many other options for adding conditional widget display to WordPress sites.

One meta trac <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627" target="_blank">ticket</a> requests that closed plugins have a public page instead of disappearing completely. In another related <a href="https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2860" target="_blank">ticket</a>, plugin team member Mika Epstein has proposed that when plugins are closed or disabled, there should be a dropdown for WordPress.org admins to select a reason why. She suggested the following as available options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Security Issue</li>\n<li>Author Request</li>\n<li>Guideline Violation</li>\n<li>Licensing/Trademark violations</li>\n<li>Merged into Core</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The issue with Display Widgets was fairly public as users posted about their investigations on the WordPress.org support forums and various companies issued warnings about it. However, many plugins are disabled without the public knowing why. Even a short explanation like the proposed examples above would be a major improvement over leaving WordPress.org plugin users in the dark. It would assist site owners in knowing whether they need to prioritize looking for an alternative or simply wait until the situation is resolved.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 20:08:29 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"HeroPress: Making My Own Normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2098";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:114:"https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=making-my-own-normal";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8262:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine." /><p>As long as I can remember being normal was my only goal in life. If only I could be normal, then everything would be alright. There was not a lot wrong in my life when I was a kid, growing up in a small dutch town. I had a normal family with 2 parents (a mum and a dad) and a younger sister. My life was pretty normal. The problem was: It didn’t feel normal; I didn’t feel normal. You see, everybody was going through life living by certain rules and I lived my life not knowing those rules. Nobody told me, but apparently they told everybody else.</p>\n<h3>Understanding</h3>\n<p>When I was 35 I got diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. I cannot tell you how relieved I was after receiving such a clear diagnoses. All those years working so hard to fit in there was an explanation why I didn’t. Why I couldn’t. That was a big deal. It was not that I wouldn&#8217;t that I didn’t try hard enough or was to lazy. There was something different about me why I couldn’t. Not understanding the rules of life? Being clumsy and inappropriate in social situation? Being obsessed about some things and totally not interested in others? It was all part of the package.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Getting the right diagnosis changed everything and at the same time it didn’t change anything.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The problems I had to face were still the same. The way to handle them just got more clear. And there was help. I started reading books, I started therapy and I started working with a coach to find a way to integrate this new knowledge into my life. I started looking at what I needed (what??) and finding ways to take care of myself. I really thought this was it. I found the keys, I could learn the rules and finally be a normal person.</p>\n<p>And then I got fired.</p>\n<p>Having a job was a big part of being normal in my head. Getting fired ruined my chances of ever getting there. I was working as an assistant manager in the local library. I liked my job, and the people I worked with and they liked me. I loved going to work. But the library had to cut their expenses and I was one of the people that got fired. It happens but I was completely shocked.</p>\n<p>My experiences with jobs were not good (to put it mildly). There wasn’t one I kept longer than 2 years. You can do the math; I had a lot of jobs since I started working. Some were fun most were not. I got fired many of times. Getting fired was not a new thing. Liking a job and not wanting to get fired and getting fired anyway was what upset me the most. So I decided to start my own company.</p>\n<h3>Taking Control</h3>\n<p>Looking back it was a ridiculous plan but strangely enough, it worked out. I started helping people with their Social Media and building website with WordPress.</p>\n<p>I learned WordPress for fun. I wasn’t interested in computers or tech stuff. I was just a little obsessed with making a website for the domain name my boyfriend gave me for my birthday a few years earlier. I had nothing to say but was totally fascinated by what you can do with a website. It was like magic to me. Some written code turned into a beautiful page, or an ugly one. I wanted to know all about that. Building things with HTML and CSS was easy. Code is logic (and poetry of course;-)). It does what you tell it to do. If it doesn’t you did something wrong. Never a discussion about it.</p>\n<p>I shied away from people. It was too confusing for me now that I found something that was so easy and logical.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I could make money without seeing other people, it felt like heaven.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For a while. This is really what makes this whole thing so disturbing. I want to be alone, but also want to be around other people. I appear to be good with people. A lot of people like me (who knew?!). They have no idea how confusing it is not knowing what the underlying rule set is others are acting by. It’s like interacting with someone from a totally different culture speaking a different language but both of you don’t know that. I got really good at guessing things through the years, but that didn’t make it any less uncomfortable. I also got really scared. Because not all people are understanding and friendly when you try to explain.</p>\n<h3>And Then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>In 2011 I went to my first WordPress meetup. I was shocked! These people did what I did and actually knew what they were doing and talked about it. I was blown away with all this new knowledge and information. I needed to know more and learn more. So I went back into my WordPress cave and studied, practiced and learned more.</p>\n<p>WordCamp Europe happened for the first time in 2013 in The Netherlands. I signed up as a volunteer. I visited WordCamp NL the year before. As a visitor I didn’t know how to meet new people. That was a lonely experience. I loved the knowledge that was shared but I knew I had to find a way to talk to those people. I figured being a volunteer would give me something to do and a reason to talk to people. And it did.</p>\n<p>I met new people, I was shy, I was scared, I acted totally inappropriate and I was exhausted for a week after the event but I did it. The people were nice. Some seem to like me and I had fun. This was a totally new experience. If only this could normal.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I attended more WordCamps, always as a volunteer, that was my safe place.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My confidence grew. The number of people I knew grew. The amount of fun I had grew. And never ever did I feel not normal. As my confidence grew I got more visible and things got even better. It’s an upward spiral. This year I held my first talk, at WordCamp London. I was MC at WordCamp EU in Paris en I am on the organising team for WordCamp EU 2018 (BIG things!).</p>\n<p>Did these experiences end my quest to becoming “normal”?</p>\n<p>When I turned 40 I decided to quit the quest. I was done trying to be normal. Not because I became normal but I broadened my worldview. There are more sorts of normal than I could ever imagine. It took me a while ( and a lot of redirections) to find the one that fits me best.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Making%20My%20Own%20Normal&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Making My Own Normal" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fmaking-my-own-normal%2F&title=Making+My+Own+Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/091317-150x150.jpg&description=Making My Own Normal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Making My Own Normal"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/" title="Making My Own Normal"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/making-my-own-normal/">Making My Own Normal</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 13 Sep 2017 12:00:28 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:24:"Wendie Huis in ‘t Veld";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"WPTavern: WordPress.org Adds New Support Rep Role for Plugin Pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74726";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-adds-new-support-rep-role-for-plugin-pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1424:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/collaboration.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress.org introduced a new feature for plugin pages this week that highlights official support representatives.

With billions of dollars flowing through the WordPress economy, tensions are high, as many people support themselves and their families with the revenue earned from products and services that have been built on the existing editor.</p>\n<p>First impressions range from outright rejection of the new editor to those who embrace it and are hopeful for what it will bring to WordPress. For the past several years, most major new features added to WordPress have come through the feature plugin/feature project process where release leads and other contributors decide whether a proposed feature is ready for merge. The Gutenberg project is taking a somewhat different path to core in that Matt Mullenweg has already confirmed that <a href="https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-addresses-concerns-about-gutenberg-confirms-new-editor-to-ship-with-wordpress-5-0" target="_blank">Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0</a>, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready. This approach is part of Mullenweg&#8217;s new strategy for core development that makes releases more project-based instead of time-based.</p>\n<p>One of the most common concerns that developers and agency owners have about the plan to include Gutenberg in 5.0 is that they may need to hold back some of their sites from updating. The most vocal opponents have called for a way to &#8220;opt out&#8221; of Gutenberg so that it isn&#8217;t forced on their users.</p>\n<p>In a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://valiantchickendigital.com/blog/wordpress-new-coke-moment/" target="_blank">WordPress is about to have its New Coke moment</a>,&#8221; Nate Hoffelder shared his first impressions of the new edidtor after taking it for a test run. He said he appreciates the changes it promises but was unable to figure out how to create the blocks in the demo and worries about the &#8220;average non-techie&#8221; trying to use the interface.</p>\n<p>Hoffelder referenced Coca-Cola&#8217;s attempt to introduce New Coke in April 1985, which quickly ended in consumers calling for a return of the original flavor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My gut feeling is that if users share my frustrations with Gutenberg, they will demand the return of the old interface,&#8221; Hoffelder said. &#8220;But the official release is months and months away, so it is entirely possible that a UX (user experience) expert will force the Gutenberg developers to make Gutenberg easier to use before it is inflicted upon an unsuspecting public.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>WordPress Users Will be Able to Restore the Old Editor with a Plugin after Gutenberg Lands in Core</h3>\n<p>WordPress will move forward with the Gutenberg editor as the default experience in the 5.0 release, but Matt Mullenweg confirmed in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587616" target="_blank">comment</a> on his blog that a plugin will be available for users who want to restore the old editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg uses TinyMCE, so a better way to think of it is that Gutenberg is a new version of our approach to TinyMCE,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;It will be the default experience of WP, for people that want to use something more like what’s currently there we’ll have a plugin they can use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This should bring some relief to developers who will not yet have updated their extensions to work with Gutenberg, as well as agency owners who are not ready to give their clients access to the new editor.</p>\n<p>In his post, titled <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason" target="_blank">We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason</a>, Mullenweg shared his vision for how the new editor will will re-imagine TinyMCE and the advantages it will bring for plugin editors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Plugin developers will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they’re easier to build and have a much improved UI.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For developers who are worried about the compatibility of their metaboxes, Mullenweg said <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587620" target="_blank">a plugin will be available for providing the legacy edit page for metaboxes</a>. One commenter, whose sites are heavily dependent on Advanced Custom Fields (ACF), asked if there is going to be a version of WordPress that will get long-term support for sites that can&#8217;t be upgraded to 5.0 without breaking.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There won’t be a version of WP like that, but there will definitely be a plugin that gives you the legacy / old edit page. Make sure to let ACF know that Gutenberg compatibility is a top priority,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>Scott Kingsley Clark, lead developer of the Pods plugin, said this support for legacy PHP meta boxes is welcome news for the project but that Pods is also looking to get on board with Gutenberg once the project&#8217;s engineers have a solution for metaboxes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m very excited to start using the new meta boxes from Gutenberg once the API supports it and gives us more to utilize,&#8221; Clark said. &#8220;As soon as that’s available, count us in for immediate adoption.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite assurances that a plugin will be available to restore the old interface, some are still concerned about how Gutenberg will impact the WordPress ecosystem. The average WordPress user has never heard of Gutenberg and its inclusion in 5.0 will be a major change.</p>\n<p>In a recent article on WPShout Fred Meyer contends that <a href="https://wpshout.com/stop-presses-gutenberg-wordpress-needs-doesnt-go-nearly-far-enough/" target="_blank">Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough</a> towards giving users what they really want, which he identifies as front-end editing and the ability to create layouts within post content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg doesn’t go nearly far enough,&#8221; Meyer said. &#8220;It won’t make WordPress’ core content editor competitive with hosted builder solutions, or even with WordPress’ own themes and plugins (including badly built, bad-for-the-community solutions like Visual Composer.)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meyer believes Gutenberg has the opportunity to defragment WordPress&#8217; ecosystem of page building tools, but only if it moves towards providing &#8220;a feature-rich, developer-friendly, front-end page builder and content editor.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In responding to feedback from the community, Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has said that the project is currently focusing on editing before tackling the page building experience. The team has also been <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587693" target="_blank">working with the authors of page builder plugins</a> ahead of the next focus on customization.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is still a little early to say what will happen to plugins and builders,&#8221; Lister <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587692" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;Initially, Gutenberg is focusing on the editor. The next stage is for the Customization focus (the building of pages). One thing that will need to happen is a lot of testing of existing plugins with Gutenberg. That’s how we can ensure things do work and limit issues. Ultimately, more and more plugins won’t be needed – or at least not so many together to achieve simple things. This benefits users and creates a better, more unified experience for all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If users&#8217; first impression of Gutenberg is that it is unable to deliver on all of the lofty promises of the project, they may return to the old interface en masse. WordPress will then have a battle to convince users to give it a another chance as the experience improves to include customization.</p>\n<p>Multi-column layouts, which are the gateway to page building, are <a href="https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-contributors-explore-adding-drag-and-drop-and-multi-column-support-for-blocks" target="_blank">not currently within the scope of the first official version coming to core</a>.

The code was <a href="https://wptavern.com/o2-is-now-available-on-github" target="_blank">released on GitHub in 2015</a> and it powers the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org" target="_blank">make.wordpress.org</a> blogs.</p>\n<p>If you use O2 as a WordPress contributor or within another organization, then you have likely been a part of lengthy conversations that require a decent chunk of time to read and comprehend. Hugh Lashbrooke <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2017/08/24/o2-plugin-request-the-final-word/" target="_blank">created The Final Word for use on the WordPress Community Team blog</a> so that long discussion threads could be summed up in a single comment. He likened the new feature as something similar to the &#8220;accepted answer&#8221; function on Stack Exchange or other support forums where the best answer floats to the top. Discussions in the Community P2 often involve decision making, and the plugin is useful for highlighting the team&#8217;s conclusion on a matter.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/top-comment.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Final Word gives users who are able to edit the post the ability to mark a specific comment as the &#8220;top comment.&#8221; Other features include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The top comment is displayed at the top of the comment list with a ‘view in context’ anchor link</li>\n<li>The top comment is also highlighted in context in the thread</li>\n<li>Only one comment can be selected as the top comment</li>\n<li>The top comment flag can be removed</li>\n<li>Includes basic styling for top comments</li>\n<li>‘Top comment’ label can be translated and/or filtered</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin currently will not work without 02 enabled because of its specific way of handling comments, but Lashbrooke said it may be updated in the future to work without O2. (While O2 is not theme-dependent, the plugin is also not guaranteed to work with every theme and is recommended to be used in combination with the <a href="https://wpcom-themes.svn.automattic.com/p2-breathe" target="_blank">p2-breathe theme</a>.)</p>\n<p>The Final Word is now active on the <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/community" target="_blank">WordPress Community team&#8217;s blog</a> and is available for other teams to activate as well. With the number of O2 blogs that many contributors are subscribed to, there is a massive amount of information and discussion to keep up with. This plugin gives thread authors and team leaders the ability to summarize conversations and keep them more manageable for readers and participants. The Final Word is available on both <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/the-final-word/" target="_blank">WordPress.org</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hlashbrooke/The-Final-Word" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 11 Sep 2017 04:10:58 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"WPTavern: Equifax Launches WordPress-Powered Site for Consumers Affected by Security Breach";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74677";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://wptavern.com/equifax-launches-wordpress-powered-site-for-consumers-affected-by-security-breach";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7328:"<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/security.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/58441544@N00/2660230441">Lock</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>Equifax has launched <a href="https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/" target="_blank">a WordPress-powered website</a> to connect with consumers affected by its recent security breach, which compromised 143 million customers&#8217; personal data.

A username is part of your online identity. It is meant to identify, not verify, who you are saying you are. Verification is the job of the password.</p>\n<p>Generally speaking, people do not consider usernames to be secret, often sharing them openly. Additionally, many major online establishments — such as Google and Facebook — have done away with usernames in favor of email addresses, which are shared around constantly and freely. WordPress has also moved this way, allowing users to log in with an email address or username since version 4.5.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress Core Security Team Lead Aaron Campbell clarified this section of the handbook to confirm that the users endpoint is intended to be an open API endpoint that serves public data.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It does in fact include usernames and user IDs (among other things) for users that have published posts in a post type that is set up to use the API, but all the data is considered public,&#8221; Campbell said.</p>\n<p>Campbell also said he is wary of entering personal data into the equifaxsecurity2017.com website, but not because it is using WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the fact that it runs on WordPress is a concern from a security standpoint, with the caveat that I don&#8217;t know what ELSE it&#8217;s using,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;&#8216;Equifax&#8217; is a trusted brand, but it&#8217;s not the official Equifax domain and the SSL certificate doesn&#8217;t verify ownership. So you know your data is encrypted, but not necessarily who it&#8217;s being sent to since you don&#8217;t know who owns the site.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why Equifax simply didn&#8217;t build out the information site on its own domain. According to security investigator <a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/equifax-breach-response-turns-dumpster-fire/" target="_blank">Brian Krebs</a>, the company appears to have hired Edelman PR, a global PR firm, to handle its public response to the data breach, citing the username publicly displayed by WordPress&#8217; API.

Various browsers flagged it as a phishing threat, and some consumers found they were given different answers from the form based on whether they checked with desktop or mobile devices. In responding to the incident with a website that appears to have been hastily implemented for its own convenience and corporate interests, Equifax has missed an opportunity to reclaim any remaining consumer confidence from the public.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 08 Sep 2017 20:04:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:61:"WPTavern: SWFUpload Will Officially Be Removed From WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74660";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:72:"https://wptavern.com/swfupload-will-officially-be-removed-from-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2000:"<p>SWFUpload is an open-source library that was used by WordPress in 2011 and earlier that allowed users to upload files.

It may also be added to other blocks in the future.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/autocomplete.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;We still need to get the point-click/tap interactions right since most people won’t discover, remember, nor use keyboard shortcuts,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Matías Ventura <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587704" target="_blank">said</a> in response to user feedback on the plugin.</p>\n<p>This release of the plugin adds the ability to remove images from the gallery block inline. It works smoothly and resizes the thumbnail previews to fit the available space after an image is removed.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/gutenberg-gallery-delete-image.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 1.1.0 also includes small updates like the ability to set links to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2628" target="_blank">open in a new window</a>, accessibility improvements to the add-new-category form, caption styling for video blocks, adjustments to column width calculation in the gallery block, and many other tweaks and improvements. The <a href="http://gutenberg-devdoc.surge.sh/" target="_blank">Gutenberg docs</a> also received <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2638" target="_blank">an updated design</a> and improvements to the content.</p>\n<h3>A Preview of How Gutenberg Will Interact with Themes to Build Websites</h3>\n<p>Gutenberg engineers elaborated on how they expect the new editor will work with themes in a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/31/gutenberg-themes/" target="_blank">post</a> on the make.wordpress./core blog. Matías Ventura published two video examples to demonstrate where they see Gutenberg headed on its journey towards becoming a full-fledged website building tool. Ventura said this is the long-term goal after the project completes the post and page editing milestone.</p>\n<p>The first video shows how Gutenberg can be used for page building, starting with a blank slate and a theme that defines specific styles for blocks. The second one shows how a theme might include templates with blocks already in place that provide users with a guided page-building experience.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>These examples clarify some of the benefits the team is aiming for with Gutenberg and how WordPress theme authors will be able to build more user-friendly experiences on top of the new editor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;These are quickly put together, but I hope it shows how things can progress even with very straightforward theme integration,&#8221; Ventura said. &#8220;As soon as we expand the scope and include more blocks (site title, site header, menus, more widgets, etc), and describe a way to store page templates as a «list of blocks», Gutenberg would be fundamentally capable of building an entire website.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 07 Sep 2017 20:02:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 287 – WordPress Meetups, Events, and WordCamps with Andrea Middleton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=74614&preview=true&preview_id=74614";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-287-wordpress-meetups-events-and-wordcamps-with-andrea-middleton";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1776:"<p>In this episode, <a href="https://jjj.blog/">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by <a href="https://andreamiddleton.blog/">Andrea Middleton</a>, Dot org Wrangler at Automattic.

People would know all the neighbors, they would pay each other visits every week to talk about what’s been going on in the community and to have a beer or two. It all seemed great until the moment when I got a bit older and went to Junior High School. My hair, unlike all other boys’, was long and I enjoyed listening to rock / metal music, the genre that was considered weird, unknown, maybe even evil.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Suddenly this friendly community started treating me like an alien, someone they refused to treat as one of their own or spend time with.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Almost every day I would get some beatings from school bullies, they would pull my hair, call me names, in short &#8211; my life became miserable. I had to find a way to survive, something to focus on.</p>\n<p>That’s when I started spending even more time with my computer, playing Diablo (I even set up a Diablo fan club which became quite popular in Poland) and other multiplayer games that connected me with new people. All these interesting personalities living there, somewhere far away, (and the unforgettable sound of a dial-up modem) made me believe there was something good out there waiting for me.</p>\n<p>Next, natural step was the analysis of how a game could be created. I spent months looking at the code and analyzing its components. There weren’t many tutorials back then, so sometimes it took a while to figure things out. But it all led to building my first website, which was full of tables and hundreds of colorful elements, everything was there! I was so proud of myself! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" /></p>\n<p>When I went to High School, I already knew a thing or two about coding and I wasn’t afraid to use it! I moved to a big city, got my first job as a graphic designer and started renting my own apartment.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was very young, full of energy and determination to change my life.</p></blockquote>\n<p>After a while I got another job and another, and suddenly I realized that coding became an essential part of my life. Instead of learning chemistry and biology, I spent my nights learning new ways of improving my skills and finally was offered a pretty sweet job in a huge company, where I led a team of front-end developers. Yes, I was about 19, but I felt so mature. It’s so funny now, when I recall that feeling of accomplishing “everything”, but hey, I knew CSS ‘hacks’ on IE 6, I knew it all!</p>\n<blockquote><p>Of course, I had heard of WordPress, but none of the ‘true’ coders would use it, so why would I want to dig into that?</p></blockquote>\n<p>Well, I’m glad someone helped me change my mind. In 2010 my colleague invited me to join him on WordCamp. In Poland WordPress was still considered a cute little tool for creating internet blogs, so I thought going there would be a waste of time, but it turned out to be a life-changing experience. The opportunity to meet people from different countries, hear them talk about the growing possibilities of WordPress made me realize I was in the right place. The fact that a few people I met there are still my friends today only stresses the importance of that event.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It simply dawned on me that it’s not really about the CMS or other technical elements.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress turned out to be a tool that led me to meeting a fantastic community of interesting and friendly people. And this was one of the reasons I wanted to delve further into WordPress.</p>\n<p>Two years later I started cooperating with a company based in the United States. Their main tool to build sites on was WordPress, obviously. By the way, I’ve been with this company for over 5 years now and to be honest, I can’t imagine my life without those guys now, but I don’t want to keep you here too long, so let’s move on. I quit my safe, ‘nine to five’ job to the dismay of my parents and started working remotely. Everything was so new, so exciting, but at the same time physically and mentally exhausting. I was doing my master’s degree in e-business and I rarely slept through the night, mostly because my clients were from different time zones.</p>\n<p>To make things more exciting, I applied for a grant from the European Union and registered my own little company in Poland. But hey, I still felt unsated. It took me around a year to decide to move my company to the United States and go there to manage it. Actually, part of this time was spent on convincing my wife to quit the job she didn’t like anyway, but again, no subplots.</p>\n<blockquote><p>To say that moving to the States was easy would be a monstrous lie.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dealing with visas and all types of immigration documents is very time-consuming and caused us way too many sleepless nights, but eventually we got to California! I registered my company (again!), opened a bank account (you wouldn’t believe how difficult it was, so thank you, dear Russian lady for fighting with the system for over 2 hours!), and looked for a place to stay.</p>\n<p>Almost 3 years have passed, I’ve been given a chance to work with amazing people whom I truly admire, and I work for and with a few startups that, I admit, are close to my heart. One of the projects my wife and I are working on is a platform (based on WordPress, of course) that will help freelancers find good, well paid projects. Again, right time, right place, no doubt about it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“I know you&#8217;ve heard it a thousand times before. But it&#8217;s true &#8211; hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don&#8217;t love something, then don&#8217;t do it.“ (Ray Bradbury)</p></blockquote>\n<p>Very often people ask me if it’s all worth it, if I’m a masochist and enjoy burning the midnight oil, but I don’t see it that way. If I have a goal, whether it’s one to create a new website, or learn how to prepare real pierogi (dumplings) for my wife, I’m ready to spend as much time as needed to accomplish it. Sure, if it’s not something I truly ‘feel’, I might not be able to devote 100 percent of my energy to make it happen, but I like to think it’s a matter of making the right choices.</p>\n<p>I’m not saying it’s all rainbows and butterflies right now, I’m not a guy who spends his days surfing or drinking cocktails. To be honest I don’t think I’ll ever be that guy. I’m still working very hard and I rarely take days off, but at least when I go to bed I have a feeling that I’ve done all I could to help others and improve my skills as a front-ender, project manager and most of all, a human being.</p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Crafting%20the%20Life%20You%20Want&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Crafting the Life You Want" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fcrafting-life-want%2F&title=Crafting+the+Life+You+Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/090617-150x150.jpg&description=Crafting the Life You Want" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/" title="Crafting the Life You Want"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/crafting-life-want/">Crafting the Life You Want</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 12:00:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"Damian Samolej";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: Jetpack 5.3 Adds PHP 7.1 Compatibility, Better Control for WordAds Placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74547";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-5-3-adds-php-7-1-compatibility-better-control-for-wordads-placement";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2636:"<p><a href="https://jetpack.com/2017/09/05/jetpack-5-3-php-7-1-compatibility/" target="_blank">Jetpack 5.3</a> was released with compatibility for PHP 7.1, a task the Jetpack team has been working on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6106" target="_blank">since January 2017</a> after they received multiple reports of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/6629" target="_blank">failures with PHP 7.1 when opcache was enabled</a>.

Over the past few years the program has evolved to get better at distinguishing sites with higher quality traffic and allocating earnings accordingly. This correction, along with industry-wide declining ad rates, has given publishers more modest earnings expectations after the first few years of unpredictable payouts. Jetpack 5.3 offers customers on the Premium and Professional plans more control over how ads are displayed.</p>\n<p>This release adds the ability for publishers to display multiple ads and introduces more control options for where they can be placed. Since WordAds pays based on the number of impressions (combined with many other factors) and not the number of clicks, selecting the right combination of placement options is important for success.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordads-jetpack5-3.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Other notable changes and improvements include the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users can preview their sites without leaving WordPress.com</li>\n<li>WordPress.com Toolbar updated to include link to comments</li>\n<li>Omnisearch feature was removed</li>\n<li>Improved performance in the admin by cutting back on unnecessary requests</li>\n<li>VideoPress shortcode includes option to stop video from looping during autoplay</li>\n<li>Fixed compatibility issues with plugins using TinyMCE</li>\n<li>Re-added a filter for Widget Visibility that was accidentally removed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a full list of all the changes included in Jetpack 5.3, check out the plugin&#8217;s <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/#developers" target="_blank">changelog</a> on WordPress.org.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 06 Sep 2017 05:46:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:78:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids Attendees Share First Impressions of Gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74538";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:89:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-attendees-share-first-impressions-of-gutenberg";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2688:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/wordcamp-grand-rapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>While attending <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> I had the opportunity to interview developers and business owners about their first impressions of the new Gutenberg editor. Many attendees I spoke to had not yet heard of the project but were intrigued and decided to install the plugin on a test site. A few attendees were developers who have already contributed to Gutenberg and are experimenting with extending the editor.</p>\n<p>Those who have tested the beta have varied concerns, depending on how they use WordPress in their professions. Some are waiting to begin testing until the plugin provides a more consistent experience. One of the most common concerns for developers is how the editor will handle meta boxes. Freelancers and agency owners are waiting to see how the new editor will affect their businesses.</p>\n<p>&#8220;How much am I going to have to change what my company does as a business to build websites with this new tool?&#8221; Topher DeRosia asked.</p>\n<p>Agency owner Sara Dunn said she is excited about what Gutenberg will bring to WordPress and undaunted by the prospect of getting clients acquainted to a new interface. She believes the project has a lot of potential to solve some of the most common client frustrations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m excited about it, because I have a lot of clients who say they can&#8217;t stand WordPress because when they look at the backend and update their pages and posts, it doesn&#8217;t look how it looks on the frontend,&#8221; Dunn said. &#8220;I really think WordPress needs this move to compete in the future, and I&#8217;m excited about where it&#8217;s going.&#8221;</p>\n<p>John James Jacoby, one of the developers who has contributed to Gutenberg and experimented with extending it, said he considers it to be a very ambitious project.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is probably one of the most important projects that anyone has worked on with WordPress in a number of years, in my opinion,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;My take on it is that everyone has the responsibility to try to influence the direction that it&#8217;s going to take. If we care about the open web and the freedom of how people publish to it, then we should all try to join in and help with its ongoing development and make it as good as it can be if it&#8217;s going to end up as part of WordPress in the coming months.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Check out the interviews below to see how attendees weighed in on Gutenberg.</p>\n<p></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 05 Sep 2017 23:31:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: August 2017";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:34:"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4899";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/the-month-in-wordpress-august-2017/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6420:"<p>While there haven’t been any major events or big new developments in the WordPress world this past month, a lot of work has gone into developing a sustainable future for the project.

This is a 24-hour global event dedicated to the translation of the WordPress ecosystem (core, themes, plugins), and is a mix of physical, in-person translation work with online streaming of talks from WordPress translators all over the world.</p>\n<p>Meetup groups will be holding events where community members will come together to translate WordPress. To get involved in this worldwide event, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress/">join your local meetup group</a> or, if one is not already taking place in your area, organize one for your community.</p>\n<p>You can find out more information <a href="https://wptranslationday.org/global-wordpress-translation-day-3/">on the Translation Day blog</a> and in the #polyglots-events channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Foundation to Run Open Source Training Worldwide</h2>\n<p>The WordPress Foundation is a non-profit organization that exists to provide educational events and resources for hackathons, support of the open web, and promotion of diversity in the global open source community.</p>\n<p>In an effort to push these goals forward, <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/2017/call-for-organizers-introduction-to-open-source/">the Foundation is going to be offering assistance</a> to communities who would like to run local open source training workshops. A number of organizers have applied to be a part of this initiative, and the Foundation will be selecting two communities in the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Follow <a href="http://wordpressfoundation.org/news/">the WordPress Foundation blog</a> for updates.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps in WordPress Core’s PHP Focus</h2>\n<p>After <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2017/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2017/">last month’s</a> push to focus on WordPress core’s PHP development, a number of new initiatives have been proposed and implemented. The first of these initiatives is a page on WordPress.org that will educate users on the benefits of upgrading PHP. The page and its implementation are still in development, so <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/servehappy">you can follow and contribute on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Along with this, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2017/08/29/minimum-php-version-requirement/">plugin developers are now able to specify</a> the minimum required PHP version for their plugins. This version will then be displayed on the Plugin Directory page, but it will not (yet) prevent users from installing it.</p>\n<p>The next evolution of this is for the minimum PHP requirement to be enforced so that plugins will only work if that requirement is met. You can assist with this implementation by contributing your input or a patch on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40934">the open ticket</a>.</p>\n<p>As always, discussions around the implementation of PHP in WordPress core are done in the #core-php channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>New Editor Development Continues</h2>\n<p>For a few months now, the core team has been steadily working on Gutenberg, the new editor for WordPress core. While Gutenberg is still in development and is some time away from being ready, a huge amount of progress has already been made. In fact, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/">v1.0.0 of Gutenberg</a> was released this week.</p>\n<p>The new editor is available as a plugin <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/">for testing</a> and <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/">the proposed roadmap</a> is for it to be merged into core in early 2018. You can get involved in the development of Gutenberg by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Further reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>On the topic of Gutenberg, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/">Matt Mullenweg wrote a post</a> to address some of the concerns that the community has expressed about the new editor.</li>\n<li><a href="http://hookrefineandtinker.com/2017/08/jaiwp-an-alternative-project-to-wordcamp-india/">A new movement has started</a> in the Indian WordPress community named JaiWP — the organizers are seeking to unite and motivate the country’s many local communities.</li>\n<li><a href="https://richtabor.com/merlin-wp/">Merlin WP</a> is a new plugin offering theme developers an easy way to onboard their users.</li>\n<li>Ryan McCue posted <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/23/rest-api-roadmap/">an ambitious roadmap</a> for the future of the WordPress REST API — many contributions from the community will be needed in order to reach these goals.</li>\n<li>Want to know what you can expect in the next major release of WordPress? <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/">Here’s a look</a> at what the core team is planning for v4.9.</li>\n<li>To help combat the difficulties that Trac presents to WordPress Core contributors, Ryan McCue built an alternative platform dubbed <a href="https://github.com/rmccue/not-trac">Not Trac</a>.</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/cli/2017/08/08/version-1-3-0-released/">v1.3.0 of WP-CLI was released</a> earlier in the month, adding a whole lot of great new features to the useful tool.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><i><span>If you have a story we should consider including in the next &#8220;Month in WordPress&#8221; post, please </span></i><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/"><i><span>submit it here</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 01 Sep 2017 10:02:16 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Hugh Lashbrooke";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: WordCamp Grand Rapids 2017 Sells Out, Organizers On Board for 2018 Event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74039";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:8631:"<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wordcamp-grandrapids.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The 4th edition of <a href="http://2017.grandrapids.wordcamp.org" target="_blank">WordCamp Grand Rapids</a> was held last weekend at Grand Valley State University’s downtown Pew Campus. After a brief hiatus following previous events in 2012, 2013, and 2014, the WordCamp is back in action with first-time lead organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/mysweetcate" target="_blank">Cate DeRosia</a> at the helm.</p>\n<p>Tickets sold out shortly before the event and the vast majority of them were local to Michigan. DeRosia estimates that 40% came from Grand Rapids and 60% of attendees were within an hour radius. She published the camp&#8217;s details with a local events webpage and set up a Facebook page to increase local awareness. Organizers also received contacts from the WordPress dashboard events widget and the local MeetUp announcement.</p>\n<p>Despite being a relatively small WordCamp with 144 attendees, organizers had enough speaker submissions to fill three tracks with topics ranging from development and design to freelance best practices and scaling a business. Attendees characterized the organizers as &#8220;connectors&#8221; who have a natural gift for helping people and businesses get to know each other. DeRosia said one of the unique things about the lower Michigan WordPress community is its dedication to helping each other succeed with WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The core group in Grand Rapids, and really across the lower half of Michigan, is highly experienced and sincerely dedicated to helping people,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;No one is fighting to be top dog on the pile. No one&#8217;s gloating. Meetups and WordCamps are ways to give back, to encourage and grow others in the community. The focus is on the opportunities that WordPress can provide anyone and a willingness to share their years of hard earned experience to help others succeed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said the organizing team&#8217;s goal was to provide a little something for everyone and &#8220;an opportunity to learn what can be done and take that home to foster and grow at each individual&#8217;s own pace.&#8221; The event was marked by the friendliness and enthusiasm of the volunteers and provided several breaks and social times for attendees to exchange ideas and build relationships with others in the industry.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">4yrs ago I attended <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcgr?src=hash">#wcgr</a> and knew no one.

DeRosia&#8217;s teenage daughter Sophia, who has been volunteering at camps for years, also joined by contributing the event&#8217;s wapuu design and helping with operations. In the short interview below she describes how she came up with the idea for the wapuu and why she enjoys getting involved in WordPress events.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>DeRosia had just four months to get the event organized and said she relied heavily on information and resources from other WordCamp organizers in Michigan. She stayed with the same venue from previous camps, which she said met her criteria for making things convenient for attendees: lunch was easily available, parking was easy to find (and free), and it was within a reasonable walking distance of hotels and the after party. The camp had no issues getting local sponsorships.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our sponsors were amazing,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;We came in late to the schedule and still had the sponsorship we needed with out any problems. It helps that as an organizing group we&#8217;ve created friendships in the community, but most of our sponsorship was local or regional which really helped cement the idea that another WordCamp in the area has value.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeRosia said with the number of people who left talking about the next event, she anticipates there will be another WordCamp Grand Rapids in 2018 and she hopes to help again as lead organizer.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I knew tackling the &#8216;unknowns&#8217; of this first one (and doing it in a short time frame) was going to be emotionally difficult for me personally, but I also realized that most of what I was planning for this year would simply be able to move over into next year,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;In a sense, I was planning much of the next camp while planning the first.&#8221;</p>\n<p>As a first-time organizer, DeRosia said she was impressed by the volunteers, speakers, and attendees&#8217; positive attitudes and their willingness to help given the short time frame.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Aside from being terrified of what I didn&#8217;t know, it was actually a very positive experience,&#8221; DeRosia said. &#8220;I had tons of encouragement from our organizing team and the community at large. I was really able to build on the success of the first three Grand Rapids WordCamps, WordCamp Ann Arbor, and the newest area WordCamp in Jackson (MI). I had serious doubts that the community would even care about having another WordCamp (Was I just wasting my time?), but they proved that it&#8217;s a wanted commodity.&#8221;</p>\n\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155129"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155129.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-sara"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-sara.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-br"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-br.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-jjj"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-jjj.jpg?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/wcgr-stickers2"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/wcgr-stickers2.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154730"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154730.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-154854"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-154854.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>\n<a href="https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-grand-rapids-2017-sells-out-organizers-on-board-for-2018-event/screenshot_20170831-155040"><img width="150" height="150" src="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot_20170831-155040.png?resize=150%2C150&ssl=1" class="attachment-thumbnail size-thumbnail" alt="" /></a>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 31 Aug 2017 21:08:33 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 1.0.0 Introduces Drag and Drop for Adding Image Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74447";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-0-0-introduces-drag-and-drop-for-adding-image-blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3151:"<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/29/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-29/" target="_blank">Gutenberg 1.0.0</a> was released this week as another iteration in the beta period that will continue on with 1.1 next week. Design lead Tammie Lister said the team decided &#8220;not let numbers set expectations&#8221; and will carry on at the same pace with weekly releases.</p>\n<p>One of the most visible UI updates in version 1.0 is the new ability to <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2447" target="_blank">add image blocks by dragging and dropping them into the editor</a>. They can be placed directly within the content (between blocks) and also onto the image block placeholder. Gutenberg includes a blue line indicator for dropzones where users can place an image.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gutenberg-image-upload.gif?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>After testing I found this feature works smoothly but is a little slow. The slight delay of uploading the image after placing it may leave the user confused about what is happening. However, feedback on this particular pull request indicates that the team is working on displaying an immediate reaction to the image having been dropped, instead of waiting for the upload to finish.</p>\n<p>This release also <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2452" target="_blank">merges the paragraph and cover text blocks</a>.

I don’t know how this number &#8217;33&#8217; sounds to you, but in some ways, I feel it’s a big number. I know many of you would argue that 33 is not an age to be considered old. In this article I will share about my career with <strong>WordPress</strong> lasting over 13 years, and how I am planning to retire within a year, more or less. And if you are an <strong>Entrepreneur</strong> yourself or self-established person, I think this will be an intriguing discussion, I will add some key pointers from my life that lead me to this decision.</span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/edit_IMG_1358.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2067 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/edit_IMG_1358-1024x819.jpg" alt="Me Enjoying the Sun & Jetpack Tees after a long drive to Key West!" width="960" height="768" /></a>Me Enjoying the Sun &amp; Jetpack Tees after a long drive to Key West, FL!\n<h3><b>What do I mean by &#8216;retire&#8217;?</b></h3>\n<p><span>So, may be you are shocked to just see the title. The word ‘retire’ could be little confusing. Does that mean I am going to take leave from all of my ventures permanently? Will not be involved with anything day to day basis. And will be walking out in my beach-shorts in broad daylight, or vacationing endlessly anywhere in the world? </span></p>\n<p><span>In some sense, Yes, in some sense, No. The kind of office I have I could literally go in shorts though, and my life has given me the opportunity to vacation as I want, almost!</span></p>\n<p><span>But, yes, I am talking about taking leave from most of my ventures, at least not being involved day to day. And kind of taking a break to reflect more into life. I have been working tirelessly for a decade. I need some kind of breathing space, it&#8217;s not exactly what you think though. It’s kind of reboot. I will keep expanding the idea throughout the article. If you are really into, sadly you have to keep reading.</span></p>\n<h2><b>So, who am I?</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am not sure how boring this might get, but still, let me introduce myself.

As this article is entirely about me, you have to tolerate a lot more. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" /></span></p>\n<p><strong>This is going to be the biggest ever article published in HeroPress!</strong></p>\n<h2><b>So, I always wanted to do WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>No, obviously not. In my childhood I always wanted to be <strong>a scientist, a Physicist</strong> to be exact. And it&#8217;s not just like an aim-in-life, I was literally very serious. I was always into Space Science. Later it grew more into Physics. To give you an idea how serious I was, let me tell you something. While going through some old boxes, I found out some paper-cutting from back in 1993(I was in 3rd Grade back then), about coverage of different space exploration, news about Pioneer, upcoming plan on a Probe in Saturn. I literally had a file to collect those. Back in that day, that&#8217;s what you could do most, without any internet, and from a remote part of <strong>Bangladesh</strong>.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was not extremely good in school, it&#8217;s not like what you read in the story, never stood 2nd type(always 1st)! It&#8217;s more like I never stood 1st type! But I was good in math, I was always progressing, and the main blessing I had in my life was support of my parents, unlikely most parents in our time, they never pushed me into things, never tried to push their judgment into my life. When I advanced from one Class to another, making some progress, they were happy with it, and I always made progress. So, they were happy, I was happy being a mediocre-student. But the issue was, in my mind, I was the best. I know how childish it sounds, but I was really a child back then! I always thought that I am best if I try enough, and if I was given enough opportunity. So, Instead of trying to do best in the Class, I focused on many things, like starting a Detective Company to Secret R&amp;D Team, and none of those was a joke, we were serious. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Reading!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I always loved reading, and I was extremely lucky to have so much opportunity to read in my childhood. My house has some collection of children’s book, some cheap but interesting translation, my parents always brought me books on every possible occasion, as that&#8217;s what would make me happy. When that was not enough, I practically sneaked into most houses in the neighborhood. I was in 7th Grade at that time, and if a neighbor had an older kid they would have more books, and good part was if you show interest in reading books, and return it carefully, they would not mind to open up their bookshelf door for you, and most of them even loved me for this. Later on, I also finished up most of my relatives collection in the same town. Later on when in high-school everyone around knew I love books. Later on, this grew on my friends as well. I was lucky to have good childhood friends, who also enjoyed books as well. So, we would gift books to each others birthday, so we could read it ourselves. And few of my friend was very good students, and they always got some scholarship money, so we spend everything in our school life on books!</span></p>\n<p><b>So, what was I was reading? Everything!</b></p>\n<p><b> &#8211; Everything!</b></p>\n<p><span>Starting from Children’s story later grew into Detective Story, Science Fiction, and later into the adventure story, literature, whatever comes into my hand. One interesting thing I also did from the very early stage, keeps track on what I am reading. It probably came from my hobby of collecting Stamps. We used to make notes and categorize our collection. So, I started doing the same for Books. I made a notebook, started noting and making a list of what I am reading, later on, I started to make some remarks, note, what I liked, what not. </span></p>\n<h2><b>Writing!</b></h2>\n<p><span>In my teenage life writing took even more meaning. I was always good at expressing myself, and creative writing. But when one of our best friends left the country, and the only way to communicate was to write letters, so, we started to do that. It took different turn very soon. We were enjoying writing letters so much, few of us in the same class who we see every day also started writing letters to each other. However, it was nothing like a love letter or anything related to the affair, we were writing about anything, everything. At one point we were in a competition who could write the longest letter. In this competition, one of my friends wrote a letter to me (again from the same class, sitting almost on my next desk! <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f600.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" /> ) over 50 pages, and to defeat her I wrote an over <strong>100-page long letter</strong>! </span></p>\n<p><span>*If you are wondering what I wrote in those 100 pages &#8211; I have a very large family, where my relatives of great-great-grandfather’s cousin’s and their family are still very connected and if you saw me talking with any of them you would think they are my 1st Uncle or Aunt. So, what I did is wrote about my whole family tree, describing family history and later on describing each and every member I could remember! In my house we had a very old “Family Birth Register” (জন্ম কষ্টি খাতা), dating back in the early 1900s, I even took help from it!</span></p>\n<p>Over all this had a different impact on our life. I don&#8217;t know how hard it is to believe, but I was into Bangla Literature, specially poem as well, I even had a notebook full with my own poem! One of our classmates even wrote a full-blown 150+ pages novel in that age! And I am still enjoying writing!</p>\n<p><b>Dramatic changes in my Educational life!</b></p>\n<p><span>As described earlier, </span><span>I was average in studies</span><span> but not extremely good. And I was happy about it! All my </span><span>close friends were very good students and would achieve the first or second position in class every time. Whereas, I was happy being in the 8th or 10th position. But as said in my mind I was the best!</span></p>\n<p><span>Our educational system requires you to memorize and write as it is. But I was driven into reading books, and other things (also including playing Cricket seriously). I never tried to focus on memorizing anything. And from childhood, teachers grow an impression of what to expect from a particular student. So, for an example, my social science teacher knew for years what to expect from me, and it&#8217;s very hard to get past that impression. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was advancing from Grade 8 to 9, I took part in a Scholarship exam. </span><span>We prepared for a year. Only a handful of us was participating from our school, I was among those few, but I had literally zero chance to get the scholarship. I was not very bothered about it at all. But during the exam, we had to travel to another town to the exam, and it was in the month of Ramadan, and I did not break my fast. It was hard, I had 2 exams in a single day. When I came back home one day with my father, my mom was sad seeing me so tired and drained out. But was happy that I was still fasting. Then she told me something very simply, which started a chain-reaction in my life. She told me, &#8220;You think of yourself so highly, you spend all of your time with those same kids, who are doing so good in school. But if you really think of yourself so highly, why not try to reflect that in your grade?&#8221;</span></p>\n<p><span>Maybe it&#8217;s very normal for parents to talk like that. But as my parents never compared me with anybody or always let me do in my way, I kept on thinking about this. </span><span>What clicked in my mind was that, i</span><span>f I am really good, I should be able to do good in any circumstances, if this requires me to memorize everything I could do that. If I want to be really that good, and be a good scientist, I need to learn to cope up and fight in any situation. </span></p>\n<p><b>So, I changed myself, was even memorizing books, that I absolutely did not like!</b></p>\n<p><span>In grade 9 &amp; 10, I studied very hard. I changed my lifestyle a lot. I changed the way I write in exam paper to change the impression of my teacher. Before I was always like studying in my mind, not writing what I just read, I forced myself in writing those answer I just read, it was very hard and boring at the beginning. But I had a very good private tutor, who guided me in every way. Later on my teachers in school helped in every way possible. In Bangladesh student have to take a part in a Certification Exam after 10th Grade, to advance in College, its called SSC, Secondary School Certificate Exam. I prepared for that. At the end of 10th Grade, I almost had the book fully memorized, I could write as it is, correct to each and every comma and space. I improved my english a lot. I learned some calculous which was not part of our curriculum, just to advance myself for college, and I knew if I had to do better in Physics I need to learn math and Calculous better. I did took part in more Prep test than most other students. And ultimately in the School Preparation Exam, I did extremely well to boost up my energy!</span></p>\n<p><span>Everything was perfect, we took part in the big exam!</span></p>\n<p><b>And I did not get the grade I expected!</b></p>\n<p><span>Interestingly our batch did not get good grades in SSC</span><span>, we were the first batch in a new grading system, and we did not know that even before the exam, so none got perfect grade of 5.0, I got a very average grade(not bad, but not very good either). I was extremely disappointed, broken, but later learned to cope up.</span><span> I realized a good lesson of life that </span><b>&#8211; Even though you may work hard and go to great lengths to do everything possible, still you might have to deal with failures and disappointments.</b></p>\n<p><span>Another good thing also happened in my life too. I moved from the small town I grew up, <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishwardi_Upazila">Ishurdi</a></strong>, to the Capitol of the Nation, <strong>Dhaka</strong>, and was able to get a chance in the entrance exam, of all big colleges in the country where I tried. This gave me a huge boost in confidence. I selected to study in <strong>Notre Dame College</strong>, in English Medium of Science. It was another controversial decision I made, for me a kid coming from rather a small town, and from Bangla Medium it was a tough decision, but I stick to it for the future, because I still wanted to be a Physicist, wanted to study further in my life, I knew I had to be in English Medium.</span></p>\n<p><b>I had very hard time at the beginning of College!</b></p>\n<p><span>At the start it was very hard, our whole group suffered a lot to cope up with new curriculum, our first semester in College was the worst. But later we learned to cope up, we were 130 students in our Group (famous Group 8 in Notre Dame College), we all were helpful to each other, not everyone had private teacher in this point, we shared our notes, I was living first time without my parents, I was also dealing with occasional sickness due to not eating properly. So, there was a lot of struggle, but by the end of 1st year, I was dealing with everything properly. I got a good friend circle, I was not only doing well in college, I was also enjoying my freedom and mostly dealing with anything life throws at me!</span></p>\n<h2><b>My Introduction to Computer &amp; Programming!</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, I always loved programming, before entering University I already knew some basic programming, like qBasic, FORTRAN, even some level of Pascal. The kind of society I grew up, a computer was extremely rare before the year 2000. I was kind of lucky to be able to learn basic computer usage starting from the year 1998, got my first computer in 1999. It was so rare to own a computer in that time for that part of the word, that I was not only the first kid in my class to own a computer, but only a handful of people in my town knew how to use a computer. So, though I am not from a very rich or privileged family, extremely lucky that my parents understood the importance in that time. </span></p>\n<p><span>Another interesting aspect was unlike most people, I was not fully taken over by Computer Games. I am not saying gaming is bad, but most of the people I later see own a computer, the main thing they do with it was playing the game all the time. And you have to understand that almost pre-internet period in Bangladesh. I use the internet first in my life back in 2001. I was more into tweaking things, trying to create or modify the software or create very basic type tools. I am super amazed by internet from first interaction. The search engine was in its peak time, discovering new resource was easy. I tried creating my first webpage in Yahoo Geocities back in 2001, wap page generator was also taking shape in coming years. </span></p>\n<p><b>Say Hi to WordPress in my life!</b></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2068 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Asif-R1-1024x863.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="809" /></a>M Asif Rahman &#8211; Wearing Tees by WordPressian Group!\n<p><span>      I created my first blog back in 2003 in Blogger, but while trying to add a sidebar and customizing home page look, I find it&#8217;s very difficult for me to do anything in ASP.net, then I found WordPress, back in the year 2004. I still remember reading Matt’s blog and write up about how the whole project is moving ahead from b2 cafelog. WordPress was so easy, I hardly knew any PHP in that time, but my HTML and CSS knowledge was well enough for me being able to edit my personal blog. At the start hosting was one issue, but again I was lucky to manage one. Later when WordPress.com came, I migrated my blog over there and was happy at the beginning, as less hassle. I was also heavily involved with forum community. There was some very large community for webmaster and developer, I loved PHPbb and other solution for forums as well. But after experiencing some massive vulnerabilities, which lead to a major data breach, I focused more on personal blogging and soon into web development. Wth WordPress it was extremely easy to create a website, plugin and theming turn out to be not a complex task. The community and developers contributing in this ecosystem were another main factors. I feel very connected with the whole ecosystem, eventually became habituated with this, and started to feel it&#8217;s my comfort zone.</span></p>\n<p><b>How I started my career and company!</b></p>\n<p><span>I was using the name A. R. Communication, an as an acronym of my initials (Asif Rahman) back in 2001 as well, but it was nothing serious, no particular business. When in college, to support myself I first started a Marketing Trainee job in a Multi-international company. It was convenient with my college time and location, and they were literally paying to learn things. I started it just the as need of money, but later I enjoyed marketing, corporate training, and even enjoyed sales training as well. But I never took that job a as career choice.</span></p>\n<h3><b>My first venture!</b></h3>\n<p><span>In the year 2003, before even going to Universities I started a full 4 color magazine, printed publication with a close friend of mine. It was a fun ride. The name of the magazine was “</span><b>Fortnightly Tumi</b><span>”, the Bangla word “Tumi” means “</span><b>You</b><span>”! It was a lifestyle Magazine. My family already had a history with the printing business, so I had some experience. We did this business very thoroughly if you consider this as our first venture. We did a proper market study, interviewed potential readers, organized group discussion, and got good funding. And we also started with bang! Hired renowned journalist and writer. I was barely <strong>19 years old</strong> that time, have very experienced people in my team over 50 years old, and managing them was good lesson. All together we published 3 edition, with good marketing trick we were able to sell 10,000 copy nationwide for that last edition, we had over 20 big brands in the country advertising with us. But still, that business did not work out. We had to shut down, as our investor (my friend’s family) want us to focus on our education instead of this, and we were probably way ahead of our time.</span></p>\n<p><b>Too many choices after college!</b></p>\n<p><span>I did fairly good in college, despite being in English medium. I applied for the various scholarship in different university all around the world, and was in a process of ISSB for Airforce as GD Pilot, the whole process was lengthy, and I was only doing it for 2 reasons.</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><span>One of my friends asked me to collect the form, as it was close from my house, and I thought why not fill up together.</span></li>\n<li><span>GD Pilots also get the chance of studying Aeronautical Engineering and even switch to Engineering in future, and they will have a chance to study higher in that subject, which could open up my door for getting into Space Science. All for free, paid by Govt.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>Interestingly I get past all the test and selected finally. But they informed me, I have to stay in GD Pilot as a cadet and will be commissioned in 2 years, but have to think Pilot as a career, I was confused, I never enjoyed or felt the passion for speed before in my life. And we had few months time before joining the Force.</span></p>\n<p><span>In the meantime, I got so many opportunities in various universities. And one of my dream to study further in Physics was too close, as I got a chance in Uni Penn, and got a scholarship there as well. I had few other opportunities at Canada and Australia. I even applied for Visa for Australia as well, but later had to decide against all of those for some family and personal reason. </span></p>\n<p><span>I ultimately left Air Force as well, me &amp; my parents agree that&#8217;sts not a good career choice for me, given the option I had. I got a scholarship at North South University in Electrical &amp; Telecommunications Engineering. And as I started my company seriously at beginning of 2004, then a University that offers Open Credit, where I am able to choose my workload, it was just convenient. So, out of all promising option, I almost chose the risky one, to make my own company and study in Bangladesh, at least for the Bachelor.</span></p>\n<h2><b>The inception of ARCom:</b></h2>\n<p><span>Actually, ARCom is the short version of A. R. Communications. As I found making website too easy with WordPress, and a new found talent was helping me as well. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just as I never waste time on gaming, rather enjoyed my time to tweak things, creating new application. Instead of most people, when they visit a new website, they look at the shiny look, or how good or better information it provides, whenever I visit a good site, I was always thinking how they are making money, how is this built and sustained. This quest has helped me making our first successful business. It took years, it did not turn into something very big in a night. During University years I did make many different kinds of websites, in that time I started earning first from selling websites. That was during the year 2005 or 2006, it was long before Sitepoint turn into Flippa, back in the shining days of DigitalPoint! I used that money to buy more domain. I hired my university classmate to work with me. The first outsider I hired in my company was a designer, as I needed help in there. Later it kept growing over the year.</span></p>\n<h3><b>First Big Success:</b></h3>\n<p><span>Though I already enjoyed some good (if not very big) payday by selling a website, point to note here, I was selling website as a business, not like you design a site and sell, its more about creating a business, create a process and sell it for a 2X &#8211; 5X yearly profit. But my big success came after 2008. Everything was turning so well, I was done with my University. My company was already a Team of over 20 people, with an office of 2500 square feet space. We started </span><a href="https://thetechjournal.com"><b>The Tech Journal</b></a><span>, it worked so well in every aspect. As I was into writing blogs and also into the gadget. After the first iPhone release I was involved in many ways, from working with the secret group who were Jailbreaking each and every firmware, also new kind of responsive websites, I was also into News &amp; those kinds of stuff. And because of my quest to understand how a thing works, I had a good grasp already into Content Distribution. Facebook and other Social Media are playing a role in content and distribution already. It all helped.</span></p>\n<p><b>The Tech Journal became very big!</b></p>\n<p><span>Within 6 months of start, we ranked within top 20k website. I was enjoying the ride to play with monetization and taking things into next phase. At one pick point, we were ranked even within top 4000 websites in Alexa. I had a good team with me. I finished my university already, 3 of my University friend was working with me full time. We all shared same vision for The Tech Journal, and it kept on growing. Because of our experience with WordPress we kept on innovating, for us we could build anything in WordPress, I had a solid Development team as well.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Marriage &amp; Beyond!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I got married at 2009, I was 25 years old back then. I don’t know if there is any perfect age for marriage, but I felt that was the right time, I was doing good in business, was looking for more stability in emotional life as well. I suddenly found my long lost childhood friend, <strong>Bipasha</strong>, whom I did not have any communication for past 13 years, but suddenly fall in love and we decide to get married. <strong>Just like that!</strong> I will not go into details here(it&#8217;s already too big) how we studied together since 1st grade and got detached when we were in 7th Grade, but still got married 13 years later. We started a new life, life was never better!</span></p>\n<p><b>Moving Further with WordPress:</b></p>\n<p><span>Over the year WordPress kept growing so was I. I was writing, blogging, building things with WordPress. WordCamp was already something, but I was not able to attend or participate as I was still in Universities, but after finishing up, I decide to get more involved. I spoke in my first WordCamp in WordCamp Melbourne. For many years I was also very vocal about security and optimization, so I started to get so many opportunities into speaking and participating in various things. I still remember I spent one crazy summer in the US, participating 6 WordCamps, visiting 9 States and 13 cities in the process, starting from Boston and finishing at San Francisco! </span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2069" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Asif-Speaking-At-WordCamp-SF-2014-V1.1-1024x514.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="482" /></a>WordCamp SF 2014 &#8211; Mission Bay Conference Center\n<p><span>I was very lucky to be able to speak at last ever WordCamp San Francisco.</span></p>\n<p><b>Pursuing more into Investment!</b></p>\n<p><span>It&#8217;s mainly because of <strong>The Tech Journal</strong>, I was involved in many tech conferences, and always getting the pitch from various startups. And my new grown circle of friends from WordPress and various other tech scenes, I already established a good connection in Silicon Valley. It was in the year 2009 when I made my first Angel investment, the credit must go to my friend circle, it was years before Angel List, there was offline syndicate where folks will share investment opportunity. But I really loved talking with young entrepreneur and seeing how new business works. I kept my focus in my sector, the field I understand. So, I mainly invested in tech. Out of several investments, one of my lucky ones was Facebook, I was able to invest in <strong>Facebook</strong> before their IPO, not very early, but still Pre-IPO stage, it was one of my lucky breaks. As I was already doing good in my business I tried to utilize it. I did not start investing because I had too much cash laying around, I started because I liked those opportunities, I wanted to help those ideas or startups.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Moving into the US:</b></h2>\n<p><span>I started another business in US, where my partner was from Orlando, I spent one Thanksgiving with my Wife in Orlando, really loved the place, people, and we already got a long term Visa, and had full opportunity to live anywhere we want. My company in Bangladesh was already in a stable phase, and as I was traveling heavily for years, my team was used to being managed remotely, so it was not a hard decision. But staying far from parents was hard. So, what we started maintaining both houses in Bangladesh and Florida. For years we spend some part of the year in US, rest in Bangladesh. </span></p>\n<h3><b>Child &amp; Changes in Life!</b></h3>\n<p><span>Like everybody else our life was bound to change when we had baby. In year 2014 we were getting for our first baby. We decide to stay in US, because of better medical facility and my involvement in different things. Just a month after speaking at WordCamp San Francisco in November we were blessed with <strong>Aaniyah</strong>. Actually, our life already changed when we were planning and waiting for the baby. I was feeling the work routine I have would never let me spend the time I want to have with my baby.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2070" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Super-Laugh-1024x691.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="648" /></a></p>\n<h2><b>Analytify &amp; A New friendship!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I became friends with </span><a href="http://www.adnan.pk/"><span>Muhammad Adnan</span></a><span> online back in 2014, he was working with his premium Plugin <a href="https://analytify.io/"><strong>Analytify</strong></a> back then. I found this as a real good project and started talking with him, giving him various advice, and we later decided to team up, and we released the first free version of Analytify WordPress plugin on 1st January 2015. It was a success, it completely revolutionizes how people use Google Analytics in WordPress. Later Adnan visited me in the US in 2015, and together we attended WordCamp Miami and had a good trip and drive to Key West! The most interesting part of the friendship lies somewhere else. I am a Bangladeshi, and Adnan is Pakistani. Both of our nation has a very bad past. Bangladesh was once part of Pakistan, back in 1971 we fought for about 9 months, and millions of people died in the process before we got Freedom and Declared Independence from Pakistan. But it creates a life long enmity between two countries. I know for an outsider it does not make sense to keep some feelings for that long, but for its very personal for us. Our country lost so much in that war, even if you speak about just my family, My Grandmother lost half of her family in that war, Bangladeshi especially have a very strong opinion about any Pakistani. But meeting Adnan, becoming friends, and working together made me realize few interesting thing, this feeling, this agony against any Pakistani was one-way. Most of the Pakistani did not have any idea what their Government or Army did, they hardly have idea about their Ancestors’ doing. They rather still consider us Brother! Some of the history he never knew, they never read in their history book. I would never know this if it&#8217;s not for </span><b>WordPress</b><span>, we would never meet, this change in understanding for both of us never happened.</span></p>\n<p><span>And we together kept on growing <strong>Analytify</strong>, as the best Google Analytics Plugin in WordPress, and planning many interesting things together.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Coming Back to Bangladesh!</b></h2>\n<p><span>While I was staying and mostly investing in the US, I started investing in some interesting Teams in Bangladesh from the year 2012. Over the year, a few failed, but some really kept on growing. In the year 2016, in Pre-Trump period we were expecting our 2nd Baby, and it was too hard for us to manage alone in the US, and we both were missing our family. I want my kids to grow up having their family close to them, the way I grew up. I want my parents to feel close to them. Occasionally when we visited Bangladesh with our first child, I was quite blown away the way they loved and took care of the baby. It all made sense if we spend some more time in Bangladesh, and have the Baby in here. And the weird things going on with the US also motivated my decision. The kind of craziness we are seeing in the US, actually did not start just by having Trump elected. It goes way back. We were living in a  very peaceful neighborhood in Florida, a small town called Orange City, near Daytona Beach! But we could still feel the change in air. Our parents have a pending Immigration Application for near a decade, they are on the que to become US citizen anyway. We first tried to have them with us, but US Embassy in Bangladesh rejected that application, for absolutely no reason. And my other venture was already growing in Bangladesh. So, all together we decide to stay in Bangladesh for awhile, we moved in mid-2016.</span></p>\n<h3><b>Welcoming Aadiyah into the Family!</b></h3>\n<p><span>We had our 2nd Baby <strong>Aadiyah</strong> in September 2016, a bit ahead of time, my wife got little too sick, but we were able to handle everything because of having family together. We moved into a large Duplex house, to have enough space for the baby. We feel we are complete as family and never been this happy before.</span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610.jpg"><img class="size-large wp-image-2071" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_1610-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a>Complete Family!\n<h1><b>weDevs &amp; My Legacy!</b></h1>\n<p><span>I will discuss later my involvement in Bangladeshi WordPress Eco-system. But back in 2013 I first met <a href="https://tareq.co/">Tareq</a>, a very talented Bangladeshi Programmer, running a successful WordPress product company. He and his Partner <strong>Nizam</strong> built an amazing company, and they had few very interesting and super successful products for WordPress. I started helping as possible from my end, I want them to succeed and pushing them to move forward. I became an official partner and board member of <a href="https://wedevs.com"><strong>weDevs</strong></a> back in 2015. I was helping them to grow internationally and advising them as part of the board. We established a US company and kept on growing. Though I was in WordPress for very long time, my main company <strong>ARCom</strong> was never serious into WordPress Product. I released some of <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/asif2bd">our work</a> in Open Source via WordPress.org Plugin Directory, and with my growing experience with <strong>Analytify</strong> made me dig more into WordPress products.</span></p>\n<p><span>Somehow at the end of 2016, <strong>Tareq</strong> and I was looking at our numbers for <strong>weDevs</strong> in 2016, we noticed something very important. Three of us spend more time digging deep into the numbers and re-analyzed our process and priorities. Soon we all came into understanding we have to take things forward with <strong>weDevs</strong>, the growth of the industry is very important if we want to be big in future this is the right time. They proposed to me if I could take over as <strong>CEO</strong>. Nizam was running weDevs successfully as CEO for years, and I never thought seriously about running another company, and my retirement plan was already in place. But we found this could be the best thing we could do in the year 2017, where I have little over 1.5 years before my planned retirement. </span></p>\n<p><span>So, I jumped into the ship. I always dreamed to make a rocking and successful company in WordPress product space, and it was my chance. And as it&#8217;s already a running successful company, my goal here to build a legacy, instead of just making a profitable company, built a sustainable company, and proper team, a fine management, that could grow into future, that could </span><b>outgrow us</b><span>, something even bigger than us combined. </span></p>\n<a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R.jpg"><img class="wp-image-2073 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5190R-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a>weDevs new office &#8211; Reception Area from inside &#8211; WordPress Flavoured!\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>So, I took over <strong>weDevs of CEO</strong> in January 2017, I took 2 months as the transition period and blend fully into the day to day system. We announced this officially in the month of March. Dhaka is a very jam packed city with the highest number of people living in per square miles in the world. We were already a Team of about 25 people. I still had few other business that I have to take care. So, we moved to a new large space. A total of 5000 square feet space, fully open, we built a unique office that could sustain us for next few year. I moved my house and office in the same area, called <strong>Mirpur DOHS</strong>. Me, my partners, and almost 12 of us together moved into this area together. As we now live within 2 min distance from the office, the Traffic could not bother us at all. We gave the option for our employees to move into too. We paid the moving cost, we even adjusted salary if they faced any increase of cost for housing or anything. We took time, but now our new office is complete, it&#8217;s one very interesting WordPress themed workplace.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2074" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/MG_5240R-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="640" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We are growing further, our team of 25 people will soon <strong>become a team of  50+</strong>. We are working on new stunning products, we just launched a brand new super fast Form Builder plugin named <a href="https://wedevs.com/weforms/"><strong>weForms</strong></a>. It will revolutionize the way people build forms and create anything from just a simple contact form to organize a quiz. Our team built it entirely on Vue.JS, as a single page app. It&#8217;s unbelievably fast, almost nothing we have seen so far inside WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><span>Our Team internally working very hard to update our existing product and we are working on some new things that I am incredibly looking forward to. Before I join, weDevs did not have a marketing team, we ran entirely autonomous. In last 6 months, we have built a sustainable Content &amp; Marketing Team. I am working tirelessly with my CTO &amp; COO to build a new culture. We have a two-way feedback evaluation process. I created a kind of unique in its way, a grading system where the company could give feedback to an employee, on exact point, and inform directly where they need to improve. It&#8217;s a kind of algorithm I have developed over the years and really helps you to make a happy and working team. In the same way, Employee also have the opportunity to give feedback to the company directly &#8211; about what makes them happy, how a company could help him grow more, or if the company is addressing every concern properly. We do this quarterly basis, and review in each quarter, so the improvement could always be tracked, graphed and addressed properly.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Bangladeshi WordPress Community!</b></h2>\n<p><span>This is another very proud thing I would like to talk about. When I first had a very detail conversation with Matt Mullenweg, back in 2011, he was very happy that I attending so many WordCamp, and be that much involved with the community, he asked me about WP community back my country, and told me if we are able to have a good group, a nice meetup and eventually a WordCamp, he will try to attend. I found a new role for myself, over the year we grew Bangladeshi WordPress community. Locally we have very growing and engaging WordPress Group, called WordPressians, we have over 21,000 Members in Facebook. We are a team of 15 Admin/Organizer who maintains everything, and it&#8217;s an open group so always evolving. Over the year, we 15 became very close to each other, and we all consider each other as best friend. We contribute in Open Source together, we hangout together, attend various WordCamps around together now, we plan day out together as well. This is another blessing happened to our life mainly because of WordPress.</span></p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-2075" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/IMG_9881-1024x417.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="391" /></a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Starting from 2013 we are official meetup chapter in Dhaka. We organized over 15 meetup, where each and every meetup of our could be considered little WordCamp, with 4-6 session, and had 150-300 attendees. We organized all of our meetup in our own platform, a WordPress plugin we created, so everything happened at &#8211; WPressians.net, not at Meetup.com, we did it with direct permission from WordPress Foundation. We have made WordCamp Application starting from 2013. And I even faced Organizer interview twice in 2014.</span></p>\n<h3><b>But the sadness!</b></h3>\n<p><span>There is one thing that hurt me a lot. Though me and our organizing team worked so hard to grow Bangladeshi WordPress community, but due to some miscommunication, we still don&#8217;t have any WordCamp yet. The foundation failed to take timely measures to proceed with our WordCamp application, we faced repeated issues in getting the proper timely response from them. Out of frustration and years of waiting back in 2015, we organized a CMS Conference in Dhaka, where we had over 10 speakers, and there were over 1500 attendees. So our team has proven their position, but things took so long from the Foundation. I wrote to foundation much time, there is one on-going conversation, still, we hope for the best, this the way Foundation handled our communication, shows the lack-of-attention clearly. I am almost devastated in this and very hurt! When I first attended and spoke in WordCamp Melbourne in 2011, I was the first Bangladeshi to ever do so. I but I kept on pushing. Now there is over 10 from even just our organizing team where they attended in various <strong>WordCamps around the World</strong>. Last year we attended WordCamp Singapore with a team of 9 people from Bangladesh. We are gaining experience, we are driven, but still lacking behind because of Foundation, sadly! I attended over <strong>50 WordCamps</strong> worldwide, I helped to organize over 10 WordCamps in various cities, but could not organize a single one in my home country for 6 years, this keeps bugging me all the time!</span></p>\n<h1><b>My Future Plan!</b></h1>\n<h2><b>Plan to retire by my next Birthday!</b></h2>\n<h3><b>weDevs to keep on Growing!</b></h3>\n<p><span>I am here at weDevs to create and fine tune the process and build the vision. I already described what&#8217;s happening in there. From my start as CEO we are seeing about 15% month to month growth in revenue and about 20% in market reach, We will keep on doing so and beyond. And we will probably get more result in long term, and building team, forming up a new culture and getting result certainly take more than 6 months.</span></p>\n<p><span>So far the plan is to me stay in Day to Day involve up until June 2018. This is not an exact day plan, could change with time. But possibly by September!</span></p>\n<h2><b>ARCom being Autonomous!</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am running ARCom without much of daily maintenance for awhile now. I have Team Lead, Editors, Managers in place, that&#8217;s running their wing successfully for awhile now. There are few new plans and things my Team working, but all team has a lead, which they ran with ownership, and mostly sustainable. There are some places where we need some work, I hope it will be done by that projected time.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Geeky Social, 3rdBell and my other venture!</b></h2>\n<p><b>Geeky Social</b><span> has a solid team, and they are running amazingly. I am very proud of our team. I am part of the board and now serving as Chairman, and probably will continue to do so. I hope by next 6-9 months we will be even stronger financially, our month to month growth is already steady and growing, we are clear it will grow a lot from there. One of our core success is to grow beyond a cash-hungry business, which is incredibly hard if you are involved in Digital Media, and buying. But we got past that and now everything taking shape. I am very confident in the team and looking forward.</span></p>\n<p><a href="https://3rdbell.co"><b>3rdBell</b></a><span> faced so much issues over the year, but now we have a solid platform, the founders are incredibly motivated. Me and other investors are looking forward. I am still involved as Technical Director, this role could extend for the time being when we go through some changes, but we have solid plan to move forward, and by mid-next year, it should be i a  different height.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>Me &amp; WordPress &#8211; going forward! </b></h2>\n<p><span>I will have people to maintain my plugin, and provide even better support, and few of them are even joining next month, so it will be well taken care of. I will shift the community role mostly to new people and others. Next 9 months I will dedicate to have more Contributor from my community and circle. I will literally incubate contributor,  from Core contribution to Docs and Community team. I will drive more into sharing my experience and finding over the decade. Besides writing, which I think is my superpower(!), but still under used, I will drive more into Speaking. Those are my next upcoming  Session, if you are happened to any of those WordCamp, please say Hi!</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>WordCamp Colombo, Sri Lanka &#8211; 23rd September</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b><a href="https://2017.colombo.wordcamp.org/speaker/m-asif-rahman/"><span> Making Million in WordPress Plugin But Not Being Evil!</span></a></p>\n<p><span>      2)  <strong>WordCamp Ahmedabad, India &#8211; 7th October</strong></span></p>\n<p><b>Topic &#8211;</b> <a href="https://2017.ahmedabad.wordcamp.org/"><span>You heard content is the king, but are you paying attention to Content Distribution?</span></a></p>\n<p><span>If you read so far, you should understand how relevant both topic to my life! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><b>How could I financially sustain this?</b></h2>\n<p><span>I am thinking, planning and working on this retirement plan for awhile now. The main question I got asked how could I financially sustain. I don’t know what kind of impression you have got so far by reading about my life. Yes, I own several successful ventures, running a very growing and profitable business, I also invested in the 20+ venture and was extremely lucky to enjoy some exit from the investment. But not in very big scale. Some of my investment looks promising, but that does not make me very rich in cash. So this plan further is not about having tons of cash in hand laying around, it&#8217;s more about having sustainable and ongoing earning. I do certainly have some exit I am looking forward to but my plan will not depend on it. I am confident now I could easily go beyond this month-to-month type calculation! </span></p>\n<h2><b>The Hardest Part!</b></h2>\n<p><span>When you grow business for over a decade, the main challenges are people. Like some successful venture, I also have businesses that are not cash-positive but has people involved with it for years. When you run a business, you become responsible for those people, their family depends on your decision, that type of responsibilities will limit you sometimes taking logical business decision. And really relying so much into people, and the fear of let going control could be hard dilemma any Entrepreneur could feel. </span></p>\n<p><span>But over the year I learned,<strong> sometimes you have to let go to get things done for future, sometimes you have to take a leap of faith</strong>. So, I practiced that for some time now. I am positive that things will work out, and won&#8217;t break apart.</span></p>\n<h1><b>Reason: Why I am doing this?</b></h1>\n<p><span>In some ways I feel I am doing this for very long time. I have built team, product, faced hard time, and also enjoyed when things work out, I have gone through this circle so many times. There is always hard time and I have seen how it all ultimately always worked out. I kind of want to get out of this circle. Sometimes I feel tired. Though for a person like me who single handily started everything, broke so many barriers, it&#8217;s hard to get me tensed. I know how to deal with pressure, hard time, shitty situation. In some ways I am resistant to those. But when I reflect everything in my life I am very proud what I have done, what I have Achieved.</span></p>\n<p><b>Monetary wealth did not make me rich! </b><span>But the experience and relation that I cultivated did. I feel rich because of this. </span></p>\n<p><span>When I was still a teenager, dreaming to be a physicist, I had a very thorough vision of my future, I wanted to finish my PhD by age 25. Later in the course of life I became Entrepreneur. Then my goal was to become a millionaire  by age 25 and have a stable family. I was successful in that. I have the vision to built amazing WordPress team and product, I am doing that right now. </span></p>\n<p><b>I want to move on, I would like to see greater meaning of life. </b><span>That does not mean what I am doing is great, it&#8217;s just going beyond. I always thought life has a bigger meaning for me, I always felt privileged, the kind of life I had, most people from my demography could not have, so I have bigger responsibilities! </span></p>\n<h2><b>How &#8216;Big&#8217; is WordPress?</b></h2>\n<p><span>WordPress is biggest CMS and No.1 solution to make Website, but how many businesses do you see worth over a $100M in WordPress Ecosystem? Or over $50M? Not much. And because of so much recent #WPDrama, one thing is very clear, we have a long way to grow. I kind of feel to make it too big, we even limited ourself as well. I do see the power struggle inside the community as well. The most respected person in the community, now have very large number of haters, and for few semi-valid reasons.<strong> That is sad, maybe we all need to rethink!</strong></span></p>\n<h1><b>What will I do in future?</b></h1>\n<p>Maybe I will <strong>drive deep into science</strong>, I will be still 34, even enough time to study something new! <span>Maybe I will just enjoy the break for awhile. Maybe I will try to find the better meaning of life. Or maybe will write a book, I don’t know, I want to keep the option open, have an open heart. I do certainly earn this freedom myself, I am very grateful to the list of endless great people that helped me throughout the decade of my career.</span></p>\n<h2><b>Your kids to reflect You!</b></h2>\n<p><span>We all want our kids to be like us, we want them to reflect us in a good way, and go beyond. But If we are not involved in every process of their life how could this happen? If you let your family, mainly wife to entirely take care of your kid how they are going to learn from you? Do you really believe just giving 1-2 hours a day will do the trick? It&#8217;s way more than that. I want to be an integral part of my kids’ life. I want to be fully involved in their process of growing up. In this whole thing, there is nothing related of deciding fate of their life. I have no expectation of making my kids something, I am fully open, they will decide their destiny, their own venture. I just want to help them understand this World, </span><b>be their Dad</b><span>, be the friend they could play with, be the teacher they need, as long as they need.</span></p>\n<p><span>I will spend more time with my family, my 2 young daughters really need more of me, they will be 4 &amp; 2 by next year. They will go into school, perfect time for me to jump in.</span></p>\n<h1><strong>Conclusion: For You!</strong></h1>\n<p>If you came this far reading this, you could probably tell I enjoyed writing! My routine hardly gives me more option to do it regularly. I was meant to write this HeroPress article last year but was too busy, and the timing was too near of the 2nd baby&#8217;s birth!</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t expect others to try to retire early, but having a choice in life is important. Try to look back. Why do you work? Is it because of earning money? Just to survive, just to sustain your family? This should not be the purpose of human life. I believe our Creator created us for a reason, <strong>we are not meant to live and die selfishly like an animal. There should be more meaning of life other than trying to buy luxury!</strong></p>\n<p>There is a Ted talk describing Humans, how evaluated to be Human, one of the core reason was we cooked, and gathered and stored food, so we spent less time like other Gorillas to try to find food and spend most of the days for that purpose. We cooked, it was easy to chew, and it gave us more free time, so we were able to innovate! Interesting theory, but surely intriguing.</p>\n<p><strong>Life is not always about achieving it all. It&#8217;s sometimes about the journey. You can&#8217;t always win. You have to learn from the journey and move on.</strong></p>\n<p>When I look back I do see, my decision to invest worked out many ways. <strong>As I diversified my venture it was a good move.</strong> I made many mistakes and described in details here as well, but I tried to learn and reflect that in my further life. I am who I am, because of the journey. I don&#8217;t regret any part of it. If I had the chance would I have done it differently? I don&#8217;t know, maybe that could be a different journey. My life is wrapped up entirely with WordPress, I am and will always be proud of that. But maybe I need to give myself a fair chance to see the world clearly. For past 13-14 years, I have worked every day on an average 14 hours of more, I still stay at the office for over 12 hours. But I don&#8217;t do it because I have to, I do it because I enjoy it. But this is taking too much of my life, I am too swamped up. This break is necessary.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> I really like to thank Topher &amp; HeroPress for giving me this opportunity and pushing me on writing this. I was very confused as it turns out this BIG. I thought it was just 2500-3000 words, I wrote almost on the fly, so was not looking at word count. Probably this is kind of my thing, if an idea is clear in my head, I don&#8217;t have issues putting it into letters.</em></p>\n<p><em>Topher told me this is twice the size of the previous longest essay in HeroPress. <strong>I am glad if you read it completely! That&#8217;s also an achievement!</strong> Then why not spent few second more to say Hi in the comments, so I could know who read this far!</em></p>\n<div class="rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button"><a title="Tweet: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" class="rtsocial-twitter-button" href="https://twitter.com/share?text=Retiring%20Young%20From%20Bangladesh%2C%20Thanks%20To%20WordPress&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light"><div class="rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button"><a title="Like: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" class="rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light" href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-linkedin-button" href="https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fretiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress%2F&title=Retiring+Young+From+Bangladesh%2C+Thanks+To+WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Share: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div></div><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal"><div class="rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button"><a class="rtsocial-pinterest-button" href="https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/083017-150x150.jpg&description=Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Pin: Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div></div><a rel="nofollow" class="perma-link" href="https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/" title="Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress"></a></div><p>The post <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/">Retiring Young From Bangladesh, Thanks To WordPress</a> appeared first on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://heropress.com">HeroPress</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 30 Aug 2017 00:00:46 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"M Asif Rahman";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:43:"Akismet: Akismet and Drupal, Together Again";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=1960";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://blog.akismet.com/2017/08/29/akismet-and-drupal-together-again/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1569:"<p>Akismet is used on millions of WordPress sites, but it isn&#8217;t only used with WordPress.

We have challenges (user frustrations with publishing and customizing, competition from site builders like Squarespace and Wix) and opportunities (the 157 million small businesses without sites, aka the next big market we should be serving). It’s time for WordPress’ next big thing, the thing that helps us deal with our challenges and opportunities. The thing that changes the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic has been moving towards offering better support for small businesses with its 2015 <a href="https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-woocommerce" target="_blank">acquisition of WooCommerce</a> and steady commercialization of Jetpack, with plans targeted at business owners. The company is poised to capture even more of the self-hosted small business market by allowing customers to <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem" target="_blank">tap into WordPress&#8217; third-party ecosystem</a>.</p>\n<p>However, many vocal opponents to Gutenberg (and the changes that will come along with it) are concerned that the project is being developed chiefly to serve Automattic&#8217;s customers and corporate interests.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg has been mainly introduced by one particular company which seems to be in urgent need to compete with other SaaS businesses,&#8221; WordPress theme development company owner <a href="https://www.mhthemes.com/" target="_blank">Michael Hebenstreit</a> said. &#8220;That’s fine, but then keep it as a plugin for at least 1-2 years, put it on WordPress.com (to gather real live feedback and usage data) and nobody will have any issues with that approach.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg addressed concerns that Gutenberg is being developed for Automattic&#8217;s customers in a <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/#comment-587598" target="_blank">reply</a> to a similar comment on his post.</p>\n<p>&#8220;There definitely is a contingent that seems to think that, but if you think through it logically it doesn’t make sense: if it were just to benefit Automattic it would be far easier and more advantageous to just do Gutenberg unilaterally in Calypso, where it would primarily benefit WordPress.com,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Doing it in wp-admin and core first involves a lot more discussion, public feedback, backwards compatibility concerns, and breaking a lot of new ground for how core uses Javascript, and because it’s in core the benefits will accrue to all hosts of WordPress, many of which directly or indirectly compete with Automattic. We are reading and trying to learn from all the negative feedback though, even when it’s from people who haven’t used Gutenberg much yet.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Those who build websites for clients have voiced concerns about how Gutenberg will affect their businesses, whether the brand new interface will drive users away from WordPress. Developers and product owners are eagerly awaiting more answers on what it means for existing plugins and themes in the ecosystem, as the project has yet to iron out some of the more technical details regarding extensibility and support for metaboxes. This naturally raises concerns about Gutenberg&#8217;s timeline.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready, not vice versa,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We still have target dates to help us think about scope and plan for all the supporting documentation, translation, and marketing efforts, but we’re not going to release anything until Gutenberg is something the team working on it agrees is ready.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress users have been conditioned to anticipate releases on a regular schedule but the new approach to core development will allow for the next major release to wait until the targeted features are ready. Mullenweg confirmed in the comments of his post that Gutenberg will ship with a legacy interface to offer backwards compatibility for PHP metaboxes that have not yet updated to be JS-powered.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some things like toolbar buttons will definitely need to be updated to work with Gutenberg, other things like Metaboxes there will be no problem to provide a legacy interface for a few releases,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;But I would say that plugin authors should start updating their plugins in late September if they want to benefit from Gutenberg’s launch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One of the most prevalent concerns that remains is React&#8217;s licensing issues, which came to a head after the Apache Software Foundation added Facebook’s BSD+Patents license to its Category X list of disallowed licenses for Apache PMC members. Facebook&#8217;s engineering directors considered re-licensing the project but <a href="https://wptavern.com/facebook-isnt-budging-on-reacts-bsd-patents-license" target="_blank">decided against it</a>, citing &#8220;meritless patent litigation&#8221; as the reason behind adopting the BSD + patents license. The WordPress project has yet to announce its stance on the decision.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We anticipated a decision on React around the Apache deadline (closer to now), will have more to announce about WP and Gutenberg’s approach here in the next few weeks,&#8221; Mullenweg said.</p>\n<p>He also reiterated how invested he is in the WordPress project and ecosystem as a whole. His post elaborated on the many benefits he anticipates for plugin, theme, and core developers, agencies, users, and hosting companies. He challenged the WordPress community to see Gutenberg in the same light.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My life’s work is improving WordPress,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I firmly believe that Gutenberg is the direction that will provide the most benefit to the maximum number of people while being totally in line with core WordPress’s philosophies and commitment to user freedom. So keep giving us your feedback, and let’s push through the fear together. It’s worth a little discomfort to change the world.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 28 Aug 2017 18:01:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"Matt: We Called it Gutenberg for a Reason";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:22:"https://ma.tt/?p=47503";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://ma.tt/2017/08/we-called-it-gutenberg-for-a-reason/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9263:"<p>Movable type was about books, but it wasn’t just about books.

The thing that changes the world.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg.</p>\n<p>For those who don’t know we kicked off the Gutenberg project around the beginning of the year, <a href="https://ma.tt/2017/06/4-8-and-whats-coming/">I talked about it and we did our first public releases in June</a>, and the team has been doing <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-editor/">weekly updates</a> of the public beta plugin <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/">that&#8217;s available for anyone to try out in their wp-admin</a>.</p>\n<p>When Johannes Gutenberg’s press came out, people mostly used it to print the same religious text monks had been copying. It wasn’t until ten or fifteen years later that people started innovating and trying their hands at new kinds of writing, and the wheels of change started to spin faster. Now it’s WordPress’ turn to do the same. Gutenberg meets our challenges and opportunities head on while simultaneously benefitting everyone who makes a living working in the WP ecosystem. It’s about a lot more than just blocks. Our Gutenberg moves every part of the WordPress ecosystem forward:</p>\n<p><strong>Developers and agencies</strong> will be able to create interactive templates that clients can easily update without breaking things or dealing with custom post types: Imagine a custom “employee” block that you can add to an About page that includes a picture, name, and bio. They’ll be able to replace most meta boxes, and they’ll get a chance to update old code or clients to work in this new paradigm.</p>\n<p><strong>Plugin developers</strong> will be able to completely integrate into every part of WordPress, including posts, pages, custom post types, and sidebars without having to hack TinyMCE or squeeze their entire feature behind a toolbar button. Today, every plugin that extends WordPress does it in a different way; Gutenberg’s blocks provide a single, easy-to-learn entry point for an incredible variety of extensions. Some folks have already begun to port their plugins over, and are finding that they&#8217;re easier to build and have a much improved UI. I&#8217;m looking forward to highlighting those stories as we get further along and more people write about them.</p>\n<p><strong>Theme developers</strong> won’t need to bundle tons of plugins or create their own page builders. There’ll be a standard, portable way to create rich layouts for posts and guide people through setup right in the interface, no 20-step tutorials or long videos needed. Every theme will be able to compete with multi-functional premium themes without locking users into a single theme or compromising their experience.</p>\n<p><strong>Core developers</strong> will be able to work in modern technologies and not worry about 15 years of backwards compatibility. We’ll be able to simplify how menus, widgets, and the editor work to use a common set of code and concepts. The interface will be instantly responsive.</p>\n<p><strong>Web hosts</strong> will have better signup rates, as Gutenberg opens up WordPress to an entirely new set of people for whom WordPress was too complex and hard to set up before. (Remember our goal: to democratize publishing.) Their churn rates will go down: they’ll stop bleeding customers to Wix, Weebly, and Squarespace, and fewer people will abandon their sites because it was too hard to make things look they way they wanted.</p>\n<p><strong>Users</strong> will finally be able to build the sites they see in their imaginations. They’ll be able to do things on mobile they’ve never been able to before. They’ll never have to see a shortcode again. Text pasted from Word will get cleaned up and converted to blocks automatically and instantly. (I pasted the first version of this post from Google Docs and it worked <em>great</em>. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f44c.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" />) They’ll start manipulating their sites in ways that would have taken a developer. They’ll be able to move from blogging to using WordPress as a CMS without missing a beat. Editing posts will just work; they’ll write more. They’ll learn blocks once, and then be able to instantly use and understand 90%+ of plugins.</p>\n<p>I could go on about how photographers will be able to create rich galleries, parallax images, and better portfolios, or how poets will finally be able to preserve whitespace as they write, but you get the idea. It’s big. It moves the WordPress ecosystem forward, but it also moves the whole web forward.</p>\n<p>Which is scary! Because change always is, and this is a big one. But a scary thing is usually a thing that leads to growth, if you can push through it. Ten years ago, agencies and developers worried that software like WordPress would ruin their business because clients wouldn’t need help updating their sites any more, and would maybe even just start building their own sites. But their worse fears didn’t come true — instead, it created new opportunities for everyone.</p>\n<p>(People were worried when the printing press was invented, too. A Swiss biologist warned against the “confusing and harmful abundance of books,” but I’d say it all worked out in the end.)</p>\n<p>This is not to say that nothing will go sideways with Gutenberg, or that people’s concerns about it are unfounded. Making something people want is really hard to do and easy to mess up — we definitely have in the past. I share many of the concerns or worries with today’s version of Gutenberg, and we’re working to mitigate them. Gutenberg will ship with WordPress 5.0, but the release will come out when Gutenberg is ready, not vice versa. We still have target dates to help us think about scope and plan for all the supporting documentation, translation, and marketing efforts, but we’re not going to release anything until Gutenberg is something the team working on it agrees is ready.</p>\n<p>And as we work, we’re listening: feedback on core and feature plugins gets read, heard, and considered. Every review of Gutenberg, even the rude ones, has a response. Seven months of vigorous and public debate, chats, tickets, and code changesets brought us to where we are today, and there will be  a fair amount more before we can present the Gutenberg vision in a mostly-complete state. I welcome it; apathy would worry me a lot more than disagreement or controversy.</p>\n<p>Creating great software will never make every person happy. We’re not creating The Perfect Product, we’re choosing a path between many good options, weighing all of the inevitable trade-offs that come from a change, listening, shipping, and then doing it all over again. Iterating. My life’s work is improving WordPress. I firmly believe that Gutenberg is the direction that will provide the most benefit to the maximum number of people while being totally in line with core WordPress’s philosophies and commitment to user freedom. So keep giving us your feedback, and let’s push through the fear together. It’s worth a little discomfort to change the world.</p>\n<blockquote class="wp-block-quote blocks-quote-style-1"><p><em>Yes, it is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams, the most abundant and most marvelous liquor that has ever flowed to relieve the thirst of men.</em></p>\n<em>Johannes Gutenberg</em>\n</blockquote>\n<img src="https://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2017/08/metalmovabletypeedit1.jpg?w=604&ssl=1" />\n<p><em>Thank you to the <a href="https://wptavern.com/morten-rand-hendriksen-on-what-gutenberg-means-for-the-future-of-wordpress">WP Tavern conversation</a> that helped me write down many of these ideas, and <a href="https://kingofstates.com/">Michelle Weber</a>.

I live in a society where women are not allowed to work in an office. People in my society think that all women have to do is take care of her family and stay at home. Narrow minded society. But I feel proud to say that I am not part of that narrow minded society.</p>\n<p>I am so engaged in the world of the Computer and Technology since school time. I started learning about basic computer languages HTML, CSS and C. And believe me I was so good at it! Later on I choose Computer Engineering for my further study and completed Bachelor of Computer Applications. But I didn’t stop studying after that. I completed my Masters in Computer Applications.</p>\n<p>I fell in love with the programming and working as freelancer. What is most interesting is that the platform I am associated with. WordPress! Everyday I woke up with a new task and go to sleep with a new idea. And that still goes on. I am a WordPress developer at the Elsner Technology and I am so proud of whatever work I do everyday.</p>\n<p>With WordPress it feels like home, a part of my soul. And hey! it’s not the house of boys, there are so many girls associated with WordPress. In case if you don’t know WordPress theme review team is led by women. And since my society is not filled with the open-minded people I suggest “Girls, why don’t you learn/work/code from home?” After all, all you need is just a computer and an internet connection. Right? There are billions of things that you can do with this platform and you don’t even need to pay a penny.</p>\n<p>WordPress is easy and designers like that. And who knows the better color combination and design better? You got the point. There are thousands of self-employed developers and designers using WordPress. In addition the rapid female created themes on platform can itself testify to the fact that women want to make websites too, and organizations like Women Who WP are so useful and makes the process more easy. WordPress is creating more and more for business owners and women are really good at tech businesses. And India is the house of the Startup business. Even the government is also making huge efforts behind it.</p>\n<p>The Internet is saturated with WordPress. 27 percent of the entire internet relies on WordPress. From small startup to gigantic companies. Since my society is willing to keep women in the house, I would like to say that’s great. I am okay! I can work from home. But there is no excuse to sit back and let the boys have all the fun. There are plenty of ways to get involved in the WordPress community. And nothing is better than a girl who writes code.</p>\n<hr />\n<h1 id="gujarati">ભારતીય મહિલાઓ માટે વર્ડપ્રેસ સારું છે?</h1>\n<p>શા માટે કમ્પ્યુટિંગ હંમેશા &#8216;છોકરાઓ નું ક્લબ છે? હું એવા સમાજમાં રહુ છે જ્યાં સ્ત્રીઓને ઓફિસમાં કામ કરવાની મંજૂરી નથી. મારા સમાજના ઘણા લોકો એવું વિચારે છે કે બધી જ મહિલાઓએ તેના પરિવારની સંભાળ રાખવી અને ઘરમાં રહેવું. રૂઢિચુસ્ત મનનું સમાજ છે પરંતુ મને ગર્વ લાગે છે કે હું સાંકડા વિચારોવાળી સમાજનો ભાગ નથી.</p>\n<p>હું સ્કૂલના સમયથી કમ્પ્યુટર અને ટેકનોલોજીના વિશ્વ સાથે સંકળાયેલી છું. તે સમયે મેં કોમ્પ્યુટર ની ભાષાઓ એચટીએમએલ, સી.એસ.એસ. અને સી વિશે શીખવાનું શરૂ કર્યું. અને મારો વિશ્વાસ કરો હું તેના પર ઘણી સારી હતી. પછીથી મેં મારા આગળના અભ્યાસ માટે કમ્પ્યુટર એન્જિનિયરિંગ પસંદ કર્યું અને બેચલર ઓફ કમ્પ્યુટર એપ્લિકેશન્સમાં અભ્યાસ પૂર્ણ કર્યો. પરંતુ તે પછી મેં અભ્યાસ કરવાનું બંધ કર્યું નથી. મેં કમ્પ્યુટર એપ્લિકેશન્સમાં માસ્ટર્સ પૂર્ણ કર્યું.</p>\n<p>હું પ્રોગ્રામિંગમાં ખૂબ ખોવાયેલી રહેતી હતી અને સાથે ફ્રીલાન્સર તરીકે કામ કરતી હતી. સૌથી રસપ્રદ બાબત એ છે કે જે પ્લેટફોર્મ સાથે હું સંકળાયેલી છું તે વર્ડપ્રેસ છે. દરરોજ હું એક નવા કાર્ય સાથે જાગું છું અને નવા વિચાર સાથે સૂઈ જઉ છું. અને તે હજુ પણ ચાલુ છે. હું એલ્સ્નર ટેક્નોલોજીમાં વર્ડપ્રેસ ડેવલપર છું અને દરરોજ મેં જે કંઈ કર્યું છે તેના પર મને ગર્વ છે.</p>\n<p>વર્ડપ્રેસ સાથે ઘરની જેમ લાગે છે, મારા આત્માનો એક ભાગ. અને હા! તે છોકરાઓનું જ ઘર નથી, વર્ડપ્રેસ સાથે ઘણી સ્ત્રીઓ પણ સંકળાયેલી છે. એક વિષયમાં જો તમને ખબર ન હોય તો વર્ડપ્રેસ થીમની પરીક્ષણ ટીમની આગેવાની મહિલાઓ દ્વારા કરવામાં આવે છે. અને કારણ કે મારું સમાજ ખુલ્લા લોકોથી ભરેલું નથી તેથી હું સૂચવે છે કે, &#8220;સ્ત્રીઓ, તમે શા માટે ઘરેથી શિખવાનું/કામ કરવાનું /કોડ કરવાનું ચાલુ નથી કરતાં?&#8221; છેવટે, તમને જરૂર ફક્ત એક કમ્પ્યુટર અને ઇન્ટરનેટ કનેક્શનની છે. સાચું ને ?

Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/gutenberg-morten-rand-hendriksen">considers Gutenberg</a> to be a watershed moment, &#8220;This is a revolution,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a watershed moment for WordPress. This is entirely new and fundamentally different from how WordPress works and how we work with it today. I cannot overstate it enough when I say this changes everything.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen suggests that Gutenberg will allow WordPress to graduate from being a blogging platform to a platform for managing views. If Gutenberg adds complexity to the user interface, he predicts many users will migrate to simpler, hosted publishing systems.</p>\n<p>He also predicts that due to the REST API and Gutenberg, permanent fractures may develop between different segments of the community and user base.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s exciting to think about what could happen to WordPress and the web in general if Rand-Hendriksen&#8217;s optimism comes to fruition. &#8220;Whatever happens to WordPress’ user base, once Gutenberg is implemented fully, WordPress’ role in the wider web and internet community will change,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all these things actually work, and people find them useful, WordPress will herald in a new age of UI and UX exploration.

Participants and subscribers to the <a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/10191" target="_blank">GitHub thread</a> waited weeks for a decision on re-licensing while Facebook&#8217;s engineering directors discussed the matter internally. The request has now formally been <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/" target="_blank">denied</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to apologize for the amount of thrash, confusion, and uncertainty this has caused the React and open source communities,&#8221; Facebook engineer Adam Wolff said. &#8220;We know this is painful, especially for teams that feel like they&#8217;re going to need to rewrite large parts of their project to remove React or other dependencies. We&#8217;ve been looking for ways around this and have reached out to ASF to see if we could try to work with them, but have come up empty.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The request for re-licensing had received 851 &#8220;thumbs-up&#8221; reactions on GitHub and many developers commented to say that the ASF&#8217;s policy disallowing the BSD+Patents license <a href="https://wptavern.com/petition-to-re-license-react-has-been-escalated-to-facebooks-engineering-directors" target="_blank">affects their organizations&#8217; ability to continue using React</a> and other open source projects from Facebook. Others said they would like to use React but the licensing makes it impossible for their companies.</p>\n<h3>Facebook Cites &#8220;Meritless Patent Litigation&#8221; as the Reason Behind Adopting the BSD + Patents License</h3>\n<p>Wolff&#8217;s <a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/112130496157735/explaining-react-s-license/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing Facebook&#8217;s decision said that the team has not done a good job of communicating the reasons behind its BSD + Patents license and offered a more in-depth explanation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As our business has become successful, we&#8217;ve become a larger target for meritless patent litigation. This type of litigation can be extremely costly in terms of both resources and attention. It would have been easy for us to stop contributing to open source, or to do what some other large companies do and only release software that isn&#8217;t used in our most successful products, but we decided to take a different approach. We decided to add a clear patent grant when we release software under the 3-clause BSD license, creating what has come to be known as the BSD + Patents license. The patent grant says that if you&#8217;re going to use the software we&#8217;ve released under it, you lose the patent license from us if you sue us for patent infringement. We believe that if this license were widely adopted, it could actually reduce meritless litigation for all adopters, and we want to work with others to explore this possibility.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The ASF&#8217;s decision to disallow the BSD+Patents license was for policy reasons, not a legal decision based on incompatibility. Greg Stein, commenting on behalf of ASF on a separate GitHub issue, <a href="https://github.com/omcljs/om/issues/882" target="_blank">said</a> that the ASF didn&#8217;t want downstream users of Apache code to be surprised by the PATENTS grant that was previously in RocksDB and is still in React. The organization wanted users to have no further constraints other than following the ALv2.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While we respect this decision, it hurts to see so many great ASF projects get churned for policy reasons after using this license for years,&#8221; Wolff said in Facebook&#8217;s announcement. The company made it clear that they will not be re-licensing React or any other projects simply to satisfy ASF&#8217;s policy requirements.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have considered possible changes carefully, but we won&#8217;t be changing our default license or React&#8217;s license at this time,&#8221; Wolff said. &#8220;We recognize that we may lose some React community members because of this decision. We are sorry for that, but we need to balance our desire to participate in open source with our desire to protect ourselves from costly litigation. We think changing our approach would inhibit our ability to continue releasing meaningful open source software and increase the amount of time and money we have to spend fighting meritless lawsuits.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Many from the OSS community expressed disappointment and frustration in their initial reactions on Twitter:</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">\n<p lang="en" dir="ltr">“People like to sue us,” is a poor rationalization.

Doesn&#8217;t look like a map, yet, does it? </p>\n<p>When the post is previewed or published, you will see the map like this:</p>\n<div class="googlemaps"></div>\n<p>The map is not a screenshot. It is interactive. Zoom in and out and move around on the map. The <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/google-maps/" title="Google Maps — Support — WordPress.com">Google Maps shortcode</a> taps into the Google Maps API allowing a live section of the map to be embedded on your site to help people find locations and directions. </p>\n<p>Google Maps are a great way of providing instructions to the location of a store or company on a Contact web page. They are also fun to embed in a post about a favorite park, hike, fishing hole, vacation spot, or even create a custom map that charts your travels, hikes, or a specific route for shopping or exploring. </p>\n<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> <em>Google Map embeds are tricky. You need to search for the exact address and use that embed code. If you search for a business name, you may get an invalid server request from Google Maps. Also note that WordPress.com has made it easier to use shortcodes by skipping the extra code and converting links and embed codes automatically to shortcodes. This may require saving your post as a draft twice before you can see the results on the front end preview of the post or Page.</em></p>\n<p>Shortcodes allow the user to add content and functionality to a WordPress site without knowing extensive code or digging into the programming of a WordPress Theme or Plugin. With the shortcut of a shortcode, WordPress users may add all sorts of customization features to their site.</p>\n<p>There are a variety of shortcodes in the core of WordPress. WordPress Themes have the ability to enable or disable these, and add more, as do WordPress Plugins.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s experiment with the <a title="Archives Shortcode &mdash; Support &mdash; WordPress.com" href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/archives-shortcode/">Archives Shortcode</a>.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Add a New Page to your site. Title it &#8220;Site Map&#8221; or &#8220;Archives.&#8221;</li>\n<li>Type in <code>&#091;archives]</code>.</li>\n<li>Preview, then publish the post when ready to see a listing of all of the published posts on your site in a list.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Check out my <a href="https://lorelle.wordpress.com/site-map/" title="Site Map « Lorelle on WordPress">site map</a> as an example of what&#8217;s possible. </p>\n<h3>What You Need to Know About WordPress Shortcodes</h3>\n<p>Shortcodes come with WordPress out of the box, and also with WordPress Themes and Plugins. These snippets of code allow the user to add functionality to their site without touching the code. </p>\n<p>The PHP code that enables the functionality, and adds the ability to use the abbreviated code to generate that functionality on the site, is called a <code>function</code>. </p>\n<p>At its core, this is the function found to generate all WordPress Shortcodes:</p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">//[foobar]\nfunction foobar_func( $atts ){\n	return "foo and bar";\n}\nadd_shortcode( ''foobar'', ''foobar_func'' );</pre>\n<p>The attributes, represented in this abbreviated version by <code>$atts</code>, are the instructions as to what the shortcode is to do.</p>\n<p>In the expanded form with functionality, I&#8217;ve called the shortcode &#8220;elephant&#8221; and set up two attribute values, &#8220;trumpet loudly&#8221; and &#8220;stomp.&#8221; </p>\n<pre class="brush: xml; title: ; notranslate">// [elephant foo="foo-value"]\nfunction elephant_func( $atts ) {\n    $a = shortcode_atts( array(\n        ''foo'' =&gt; ''trumpet loudly'',\n        ''bar'' =&gt; ''stomp'',\n    ), $atts );\n\n    return "foo = {$a[''foo'']}";\n}\nadd_shortcode( ''elephant'', ''elephant_func'' );</pre>\n<p>Depending upon what &#8220;foo&#8221; and &#8220;bar&#8221; represent, the results would be &#8220;trumpet loudly&#8221; and &#8220;stomp.&#8221; What these represent are HTML code, modifications to HTML code, and initiates the programming such as generating a list of all the posts you&#8217;ve published as an archive list.</p>\n<p>Right now, you aren&#8217;t at the stage where you can program shortcodes and add them to WordPress Themes or create WordPress Plugins, so I&#8217;m not going to dive into these much deeper. You need to learn how these work and how to use them on your site, and the more you use them, the better feel you will have for what a shortcode can do on your site. </p>\n<p>WordPress.com offers a <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/category/shortcodes/" title="Support — WordPress.com">wide range of shortcodes</a> to add functionality to your site.

The project provides a beautiful experience for installing and setting up WordPress themes with all of their plugin dependencies, Customizer settings, widgets, demo content, and more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I was inspired by David Baker’s <a href="https://github.com/dtbaker/envato-wp-theme-setup-wizard" target="_blank">Envato Theme Setup Wizard</a> and was working to add it to my own themes but pivoted after realizing I was just putting a band-aid on the onboarding issues surrounding themes in particular,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;It wasn’t a particularly grand experience and didn’t take care of the essentials the way I was looking for.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor said he wanted to make the onboarding experience much friendlier than what WordPress products are typically known for and needed a way to get his customers started on the right foot.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Over the years I’ve had countless &#8216;how do I get this page like your demo&#8217; and &#8216;where do I even start&#8217; questions — and my themes aren’t even particularly confusing/difficult to use.&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, users have to hop from screen to screen to install a theme, recommended plugins, and apply Customizer settings. Even an experienced WordPress user often has to refer to documentation to get a theme set up with the right customizations to match the demo. The video below shows an example of Merlin WP in action as it guides a user through setting up <a href="https://themebeans.com/themes/york-pro" target="_blank">York Pro</a>, a fork of one of ThemeBeans&#8217; commercial themes that is included in Merlin WP&#8217;s GitHub repo.</p>\n<div class="embed-vimeo"></div>\n<p>Merlin WP makes the process of setting up a theme nearly effortless for users. It also leaves less room for error or confusion.</p>\n<p>Developers can add Merlin WP directly to their theme files. It includes a configuration file that allows for customization of any text string in the wizard. Theme developers add the Merlin class (merlin/merlin.php) and the merlin-config.php file, along with any demo content (included in the demo directory location specified in the merlin-config.php file):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>content.xml</strong> — Exported demo content using the WordPress Exporter</li>\n<li><strong>widgets.wie</strong> — Exported widgets using Widget Importer and Exporter</li>\n<li><strong>customizer.dat</strong> — Exported Customizer settings using Customizer Export/Import</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Merlin WP was also developed to work seamlessly with <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/" target="_blank">TGMPA</a>, a PHP library that many WordPress developers use to require or recommend plugins for their themes and plugins. It will automatically pull the recommended plugins into the wizard.</p>\n<p>Tabor said his targeted distribution channel is commercial themes, though he believes Merlin WP could also be useful for themes hosted on WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m honestly not sure if it would be allowed,&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;I guess that’s where getting more eyes on the project and more input from the Theme Review team comes in handy. I have had a lot of feedback from authors who are eventually considering adding Merlin WP as an &#8216;up-sell feature&#8217; for their lite offerings currently on .org.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Tabor estimates that Merlin WP will be in beta for another two weeks. There are a few issues he wants to resolve before bringing it out of beta. He is testing the wizard in his own products at ThemeBeans, which is what he built it for originally. The shop has more than 40,000 customers and Tabor plans to push the wizard live across his entire theme collection once the last few issues are resolved.</p>\n<p>Merlin WP is GPL-licensed and <a href="https://github.com/richtabor/MerlinWP" target="_blank">available on GitHub</a> for any developer to use in open source projects. Tabor said he is considering creating a pro version but is not currently interested in pursuing an add-on model.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m considering having an advanced version, with different developer-level capabilities, such as EDD Software Licensing support (where theme users can enter their license key issued from the developer in the onboarding process),&#8221; Tabor said.</p>\n<p>Tabor anticipates one of the main benefits for theme shops using Merlin WP will be a decreased support load where questions about initial setup and &#8220;how do I do this like the demo&#8221; become less common.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Customers will have what they’ve purchased right off the bat (instead of installing plugins, installing a child theme, importing content, setting menus, widgets, etc),&#8221; Tabor said. &#8220;They will likely appreciate the ease-of-use and share that experience with others.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 18 Aug 2017 01:19:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"Post Status: Building a healthy remote company, with Tom Willmot — Draft podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=38655";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:81:"https://poststatus.com/building-healthy-remote-company-tom-willmot-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1876:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast">Google Play</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

To figure out why this is, Millie Macdonald and Anna Harrison of Ephox, the company behind TinyMCE, <a href="https://go.tinymce.com/blog/gutenberg-editor-success-lies-timing/">analyzed the feedback</a> and concluded that many of the issues likely stem from timing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In short, the nuances in the micro-interactions and timing of UI elements in Gutenberg are a little out of sync with what the user is doing at a point in time,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;For example, a user typing in a new paragraph is distracted when the decoration of the previous paragraph turns on.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A common piece of feedback is that Gutenberg&#8217;s UI is clean but also cluttered. Harrison recorded a video of users copying and pasting paragraphs into Gutenberg and Medium.</p>\n<p>In the video, toolbars and UI elements are displayed in Gutenberg during the writing process creating a cluttered look and disrupting the writing flow. In Medium, the formatting toolbar doesn&#8217;t display until text is highlighted and the + symbol disappears if it&#8217;s not interacted with.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Based on user testing, Harrison suggests refining the timing of when visual elements pop up in Gutenberg. &#8220;Right now, menus pop up when we are trying to type,&#8221; Harrison said. &#8220;They ought to pop up when we are trying to do something to words that have already been typed.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Harrison <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2279">presented their findings</a> and suggestions to Gutenberg&#8217;s development team. Tammie Lister, design lead for Gutenberg, <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2279#issuecomment-321379994">agreed</a> that getting micro-transactions right is important. &#8220;I see this as the type of refinement post version 0.9/1 can bring,&#8221; Lister said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A few things I am slightly obsessed with is having an animation pace, story and consistency to interactions. Just something to throw in when looking at micro-interactions. I&#8217;ve also been doing some self thinking about what the &#8216;feel&#8217; of emotion of Gutenberg should be. The one I keep coming back to is &#8216;calm&#8217; and &#8216;supporting&#8217;. Just another thing to throw in when looking at these smaller details.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Developers thanked Harrison and Macdonald for collecting, analyzing, and sharing data with the team. Does Gutenberg feel heavy to you? Let us know what your experience is like writing content in Gutenberg.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 17 Aug 2017 23:06:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:85:"WPTavern: WordPress Support Team to Host Free Workshop August 23 on Supporting Themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74257";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-support-team-to-host-free-workshop-august-23-on-supporting-themes";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3074:"<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/colored-pencils.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Over the past few months the WordPress Support Team has been brainstorming ways to improve support across various aspects of the community. One new idea they are pursuing is <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/support/2017/07/the-developers-guide-to-supporting-your-themes-a-support-workshop/" target="_blank">hosting workshops</a> where WordPress.org theme and plugin authors can present how they approach supporting their free, open source products that have been released to the community.</p>\n<p>Some users approach WordPress.org plugins and themes with realistic expectations regarding the support they might receive on tickets. Others approach these free products as if they were all built with large teams of professional support behind them, which is rarely the case. This often results in frustration, one-star reviews, and ultimately a bad reputation for products hosted in the official directories. It is also one of the primary reasons developers forgo putting products on WordPress.org and simply opt to host them on GitHub.</p>\n<p>The new workshops will offer concrete strategies for bridging the chasm of expectation regarding support that exists between developers and users. WordPress.org theme and plugin authors will share the tools and ideas they have implemented to offer support while creating a positive experience for everyone involved.</p>\n<p><a href="https://kpresner.com/" target="_blank">Kathryn Presner</a>, who supports hundreds of themes at Automattic, will be leading the first workshop titled &#8220;The Developers Guide to Supporting Your Themes:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Providing support for your themes offers tremendous opportunities to educate WordPress users, from explaining how to make a child theme to offering simple CSS customisations. It also presents challenges, like figuring out how to help people who aren’t tech-savvy or need support beyond the scope of what you can provide. While many developers dread doing support, with some concrete strategies and techniques in hand, helping users doesn’t have to be a chore – and can even be fun! This session looks at how to make your themes’ users happy while feeling a sense of satisfaction from your own support efforts – a winning combination in the world of theme development.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.org theme authors will want to mark their calendars for <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20170823T1600" target="_blank">Wednesday, August 23 at 11 AM CDT</a>. The workshop will be broadcast live as a Zoom teleconference and will last for an hour, including time for a Q&amp;A at the end.

The plugin was created by UK-based web developer <a href="https://jonnya.net/" target="_blank">Jonny Allbut</a> for internal use at <a href="https://wider.co.uk/" target="_blank">Wider</a>, a company he set up for handling WordPress clients&#8217; needs.</p>\n<p>One aspect of complying with the EU&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eugdpr.org/" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation</a> (GDPR) is ensuring that contact forms do not store any personally identifiable data on the server. The regulation becomes enforceable in May 2018 and sites that serve EU citizens are preparing for the deadline with audits and changes to how they handle privacy.</p>\n<p><a href="http://www.gravityforms.com/" target="_blank">Gravity Forms</a> doesn&#8217;t offer a built-in option to stop entries from being stored on the server but GF co-founder Carl Hancock says there are a variety of ways to accomplish this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If all you want to do is simply email the contents of the form and not store the data in the database as part of the route you&#8217;d like to take for GDPR compliance, this plugin would be one method of doing so,&#8221; Hancock said. He also referenced Gravity Wiz&#8217;s commercial <a href="https://gravitywiz.com/documentation/gravity-forms-disable-entry-creation/" target="_blank">Disable Entry Creation</a> plugin. Developers can also <a href="https://www.gravityhelp.com/documentation/article/delete-entry-data-after-submission/" target="_blank">delete entry data after submission</a> via a hook.</p>\n<p>&#8220;However, the GDPR doesn&#8217;t preclude storing form entries in a database and is entirely dependent on the type of data you are storing and the other safeguards and functionality you have put in place,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a complex issue and I&#8217;m not entirely sure the EU fully understands the burden and implications that may come with it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the requirement of compliance falls upon website administrators who are the ones collecting the data. It is their responsibility to select tools that will protect their users&#8217; privacy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While it won’t provide GDPR compliance on its own, Jonny’s extension is a much-needed step in the right direction,&#8221; digital law specialist <a href="https://webdevlaw.uk" target="_blank">Heather Burns</a> said. Burns consults with companies that need assistance in getting their sites GDPR compliant. &#8220;GDPR requires adherence to the <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/07/privacy-by-design-framework/" target="_blank">principles of privacy by design</a> and part of that is data minimization and deletion.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress has dozens of popular contact form plugins, both free and commercial. Many of them store entries in the database in case the recipient&#8217;s email has problems, preventing the communication from becoming lost. Site administrators who are concerned about GDPR compliance will want to examine the solution they have selected for forms. Burns advised that contact form plugins need to do the following three things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure that personal and sensitive personal data from form entries is not stored in the database;</li>\n<li>Provide configuration options to allow contact form entries to be automatically deleted after a certain period of time;</li>\n<li>Ensure that all contact form data is deleted when the plugin is deactivated or deleted.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#8220;Unfortunately the direction of travel has been the exact opposite: contact form entries tend to be stored in perpetuity on the database regardless of content or necessity,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;Contact form plugins with options to automatically delete form submissions after a certain period of time are rare. I&#8217;ve even seen contact form extensions which duplicate entries to a separate table, which, all things considered, is madness. We need to be developing towards data minimization and deletion, not retention and duplication.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Last month JJ Jay <a href="https://tharshetests.wordpress.com/2017/06/19/wp-contact-form-remnants/" target="_blank">published</a> an analysis of how and where popular WordPress contact forms plugins store data. This is a useful reference for site administrators who are not sure how their chosen solution handles data collection and storage. She suggested a few questions for users to ask when examining contact forms:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Can the option to store data be turned on and off?</li>\n<li>At what granularity?</li>\n<li>Can the data be deleted when the plugin is deleted?</li>\n<li>What personally identifiable data, other than the data from each form, is stored? (i.e. <a href="https://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/10/eu-dynamic-static-ip-personal-data/" target="_blank">a user’s IP address</a>)</li>\n<li>Is it possible to delete the submissions on an ad-hoc or scheduled basis?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure what could be leftover in your database from other plugins, Jay has also created a &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/tharsheblows/mjj-whats-in-my-database" target="_blank">What&#8217;s in my database?</a>&#8221; plugin that administrators can install and access under the Tools menu. It is read-only and lists every table and its columns, so users can see if there are any surprises.</p>\n<h3>British Pregnancy Advice Service (BPAS) Hack Highlights the Danger of Storing Contact Form Entries in the Database</h3>\n<p>In educating website owners about the dangers of storing sensitive personal data, Heather Burns often cites the 2012 British Pregnancy Advice Service (BPAS) hack as one of the worst examples of the consequences of storing contact form entries in databases. The hacker, who was later jailed, stole thousands of records from the charity, which was running on an unknown outdated CMS with weak passwords. The site had not undergone a privacy impact assessment on its personal data collection and storage methods.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the services BPAS offers is access to abortions,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;Many of their service users come over from Ireland, where abortion is banned under nearly all circumstances. The site had a contact form where women could enquire about abortions. BPAS thought that messages were merely passing through the site; no one within the organization had any clue that a copy of each contact form submission was stored on the database. Somewhat inevitably, the site was easily hacked by an anti-abortion activist who downloaded the database. He found himself in possession over 5,000 contact form submissions going back over five years containing women’s names, email addresses, phone numbers, and the fact that they were enquiring about abortions. He then announced his intention to publish the womens’ data on an anti-abortion forum.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The hacker was caught and arrested before he had the opportunity to publish the list. He received 32 months of jail time and BPAS was fined £200k for the data protection breaches.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As well as criticizing the charity for their technical failures, the regulator called attention to the fact that no one on the staff had thought to ask the proper questions about the tools they were using; they were also angry that the site had a legalistic privacy policy which was clearly not worth the pixels it was printed on,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;All of these failures were deemed inadmissible and inexcusable by the data protection regulator. It is no exaggeration to say that women could have been killed because of a contact form.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Auditing contact forms is just one piece of the puzzle for those working towards GDPR compliance. Burns recommends that site administrators conduct a privacy impact assessment of personal and sensitive data that is submitted through forms. Privacy notices should also be clear about how this data is handled and how long it is retained before it is deleted.</p>\n<p>The GDPR was written to be extraterritorial and states that the regulations apply to any site or service that has European users. These sites are expected to protect EU users&#8217; data according to European regulations. Many American company owners are not yet convinced that this is enforceable outside of EU borders and have not invested in getting their online entities to be compliant.</p>\n<p>&#8220;GDPR provides a very useful framework for user protection, which is now more important than ever,&#8221; Burns said. &#8220;I&#8217;m encouraging Americans to work to GDPR because it&#8217;s a constructive accountable framework that&#8217;s a hell of a lot better than nothing.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wider-gravity-forms-stop-entries/" target="_blank">Wider Gravity Forms Stop Entries</a> is currently the only plugin in the official WordPress directory that addresses GDPR concerns for a specific contact form plugin. Others may become available as the May 2018 deadline approaches. Jonny Allbut warns users in the FAQ to test the plugin with third-party GF extensions before adding it to a live site, as some extensions may rely on referencing data entries stored in form submissions.</p>\n<p>I asked Carl Hancock if Gravity Forms might make storing form entries in the database an optional feature and he confirmed they are considering it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Yes, this is certainly possible,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;We try to avoid conflicts with available 3rd party add-ons for Gravity Forms to encourage their development,&#8221; Hancock said. &#8220;But unfortunately it is not always avoidable. It is a feature that has been requested numerous times in the past and I suspect with the GDPR it will be a feature that will be requested even more going forward.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 23:03:45 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"Post Status: Free speech, privacy, and the web";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=38615";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://poststatus.com/free-speech-privacy-and-web/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:7492:"<p>Politics and the web are intersecting more and more. In recent news, at least three WordPress related companies have been getting broad media attention.</p>\n<p>In just a few days, we&#8217;ve seen GoDaddy <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/8/14/16143820/godaddy-and-google-wont-host-daily-stormer-domain">shut down a site</a> for violating terms and conditions, <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40454089/wordpress-bans-website-of-fascist-group-linked-to-alleged-charlottesville-killer">as well as</a> Automattic. DreamHost received significant attention for <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/we-fight-for-the-users/">refusing to release site visitor information</a> to the US Department of Justice.</p>\n<p>I think the most relevant angle for this website is to note that it&#8217;s important for web-based services to be prepared for the unexpected news cycles that revolve around web-based properties.</p>\n<p>How well does your PR team know your terms and conditions? What&#8217;s your stance on free speech, and when can that cross a line into speech or content that your service is ready to limit? The definitions can be narrow; let&#8217;s look at Automattic&#8217;s decision to shut down a site called Blood and Soil.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s a despicable site, and it has been for a while. Automattic is aware of the sites that exist on WordPress.com, and this isn&#8217;t their first rodeo with objectionable sites receiving lots of backlash from advocacy groups. For instance, the Guccifer 2.0 person or group that hacked the Democratic National Committee was on WordPress.com, and they still are. There are countless others, some hacking related, some simply vile or hate-filled.</p>\n<p>So what makes a site cross the line for a particular service? GoDaddy&#8217;s Ben Butler <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/40411086/activists-push-back-against-the-platforms-that-quietly-empower-hate-groups">described to Fast Company</a> that they draw the line between speech and violence:</p>\n<blockquote><p>GoDaddy&#8217;s Ben Butler described to Fast Company that they draw the line between speech and violence:</p>\n<p>“We strongly support the First Amendment and are very much against censorship on the internet,” writes Ben Butler, director of the Digital Crimes Unit for <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/">GoDaddy</a>, in an email. He adds that, “if a site promotes, encourages, or engages in violence against people, we will take action.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>The GoDaddy decision (which Google followed up with as well) was especially interesting because they made the decision as the domain registrar, not a content host. In that case they weren&#8217;t actually providing the hosting service.</p>\n<p>Automattic has similar policies. Specifically, they link to <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/user-guidelines/">user guidelines</a> within their <a href="https://en.wordpress.com/tos/">ToS</a>, which has a clause for &#8220;directly threatening material.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>Do not post direct and realistic threats of violence. That is, you cannot post a genuine call for violence—or death—against an individual person, or groups of persons. This doesn’t mean that we’ll remove all hyperbole or offensive language.</p></blockquote>\n<p>They also have a specific policy (not directly linked from their ToS) for <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/terrorist-activity/">terrorist activity</a>, and a provision to allow them to remove content or users for any reason.</p>\n<p>The terrorist in Charlottesville aligned himself with Blood And Soil, prompting Automattic to pull the plug —  as the line was crossed.</p>\n<p>DreamHost&#8217;s <a href="https://www.dreamhost.com/blog/we-fight-for-the-users/">pushback to the government</a> was about First Amendment concerns as well, primarily with visitors:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The request from the DOJ demands that DreamHost hand over 1.3 <em>million</em> visitor IP addresses — in addition to contact information, email content, and photos of <strong>thousands</strong> of people — in an effort to determine who simply <em>visited</em> the website. (Our customer has also been notified of the pending warrant on the account.)</p>\n<p>That information could be used to identify any individuals who used this site to exercise and express political speech protected under the Constitution’s First Amendment. That should be enough to set alarm bells off in anyone’s mind.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Every host deals with requests that may not require visitor information but definitely do require account information. Automattic&#8217;s Paul Sieminski provided a helpful post on the <a href="https://transparency.automattic.com/2017/07/25/shining-light-on-national-security-letters/">types of requests they get</a>, and how they handle them.</p>\n<p>The US has broad protections built into the First Amendment covering free speech. Platforms are not required to meet those protections; however, many are strident supporters of the First Amendment. Those protections are often for some of the most unpopular types of content. The Supreme Court has ruled there&#8217;s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2017/08/14/there-hate-speech-exception-first-amendment/q9m4IqfQvbo24nnlnPor1O/story.html">no hate speech exception in the First Amendment</a>, and this ruling has been cited recently in a trademark case.</p>\n<p>I think the author of the above-cited op-ed makes a good point:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We can and should speak up against hate. As the Supreme Court makes clear, there’s no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. With that freedom comes a heavy burden for government officials like Baker and Walsh, who must try to keep protected speech from turning into acts of violence.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The burden is also heavy for platforms who are dedicated to providing a place for unpopular opinions. There are many times when the unpopular opinion, or anti-government opinion, is incredibly important to protect. But when speech stems over into violence, then I believe platforms have not only a right, but also a responsibility to take a stand.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important for organizations to be educated about and consistent with their own terms of service, company-wide. I&#8217;m afraid these hard questions about speech, rights, and responsibility will be pretty common for a while to come. And as fast as information spreads — for instance, the calls for GoDaddy to shut down a hate site this week came in a fury, part of a quickly viral Twitter post — acting quickly and consistently will be incredibly important.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve talked about platforms and services with some control over their user base. The obvious other side of this is that there is a whole segment of our community with no control over their users. Your theme, plugin, and WordPress itself can be used without permission by absolutely anyone, and of course that&#8217;s by design. WordPress or a WordPress-related product could be identified and criticized virally for enabling objectionable users and content</p>\n<p>As a community, are we prepared to respond to that?</p>\n<p>PS: If you&#8217;re a journalist writing about WordPress.com and issues like these, please understand the difference between WordPress.com, owned by Automattic, and WordPress the software. <a href="https://poststatus.com/resources/wordpress-versus-automattic/">I wrote a handy guide for you</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 18:38:54 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:41:"HeroPress: The Greatest Screenplay Writer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:56:"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2033";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:126:"https://heropress.com/essays/greatest-screenplay-writer/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=greatest-screenplay-writer";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14463:"<img width="960" height="480" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/081617-1024x512.jpg" class="attachment-large size-large wp-post-image" alt="Pull Quote: WordPress is not like any other open source communityI saw before." /><p>My upbringing was not quite usual Serbian upbringing. I was almost forbidden to do things I didn&#8217;t really love. My parents insisted on trying things and finding that deep passion. But I didn&#8217;t have to search and try. I always knew what I&#8217;d be when I grow up. As long as I remember, there was no doubt.</p>\n<h3>A classical musician</h3>\n<p>When I was 8 my mom took me to local music school for entrance examination. I was in! Oh, joy! Finally I was learning to play and sing, to read and write this new language. Italian. Oh, music scores too! There was a whole new world that my parents, or anyone in my family, didn&#8217;t know anything about and I was stepping into it. I was doing just fine in it.. and I couldn&#8217;t live outside of it.</p>\n<p>As time passed, I finished elementary and high music school, went to music Academy, almost finished it and then my mother died. It was 2003. Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant. There was no time for grief and I couldn&#8217;t feel the joy. I just switched off and turned to the facts: I became a mom and a wife and I needed a job.</p>\n<p>And what a job did I found. An opera prompter. Opera Prompter! God, I love that job. Every second of it for ten years. I was yelling at singers, singing, conducting, traveling, laughing and crying. My Italian was significantly improved. Working time was great &#8211; so much free time to be a mom, study for Academy, get a hobby&#8230;</p>\n<h3>Opera prompter&#8217;s hobby</h3>\n<p>In 2007 I was administrator in one English speaking forum with focus on software and hardware topics. It helped me to significantly improve my English. And my tech knowledge. Which was close to none when I registered. As one of administrators, occasionally I had to tweak site here and there. It was great! There was this code and when I would change something in code it would show on the site. Neat! I loved reading those files, finding patterns and parts written in humanly understandable forms. Later I learned those were called loops and conditionals. Also later I learned that this language is called PHP and that many other languages for building websites exist. Forum script was phpBB3.</p>\n<p>I was never a gamer. Never understood the point of game, besides finishing it. I guess PHP was to me what games are to passionate gamers. Like a puzzle or sudoku.</p>\n<p>At the same time my marriage was turning from bad into worse and in the beginning of 2008 I finally decided it was enough. We were working on Mozart&#8217;s “Don Giovanni” in Theater. I remember this so clearly because my divorce was just turning from bad into worse. Those few months lasted for centuries after which I still needed a lot of time to recover what&#8217;s left of my self-esteem. My complete mental and emotional health was destroyed after years of domestic violence.</p>\n<p>2009 was important year for me. The cognition of possibility to have local server on my own machine and test everything before executing it on live site turned out to be very helpful.</p>\n<p>In October I needed a blog script and friend recommended WordPress. It was 2.9 version. It didn&#8217;t really work well but everyone was writing about it. There were at least 5 new tutorials on various blogs every day. I was digesting them every morning with my first coffee. The ones I really liked I even reproduced in my shiny new localhost. Soon enough I developed a local monster with different widgets on each page, future posts archive, post series done with custom fields and God knows whatnot. This WordPress was slowly taking over my free time. Every second of it.</p>\n<h3>So, the WordPress it is</h3>\n<p>One day a friend of mine asked me to build him a website for his ensemble. And for money. Money? I never thought of getting money for this. This was too good of a hobby. But he&#8217;s a friend so I did it. Then another friend showed up with the same request. And another.. I became freelance WordPress developer before I could even understand what was happening. It wasn&#8217;t really a favor to friends any more. I was a single mom with mortgage. My daughter was in primary school, life costs became serious while the art-and-culture salary was silently and regularly reduced.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was freelancing every single minute I could. Sleeping was luxury I could afford on weekends.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My dad was helping me tremendously. He was babysitting during theater&#8217;s rehearsals and performances in the evenings. When I&#8217;d get home, my daughter was sleeping, tomorrow&#8217;s meals cooked, dishes done and shining. I could go on like this but it was uncertain for how long.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 2013 I was recovering from what was supposed to be routine gallbladder surgery and what nearly cost me life. Almost fully operational, I was getting ready for next roller coaster known as a mix of school year, freelancing and theater&#8217;s season. Then my father died. Suddenly. In an accident.</p>\n<p>Oh, this screaming silence..</p>\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t think. Or breathe. For months. I needed someone to put the roller coaster on pause. Just.. Just a short one. To take a breathe. But there was no one. I was all alone with a 9 years old child who had to grow up fast. I had to grow up fast.</p>\n<blockquote><p>All of a sudden I realized that I can not afford a single mistake any more. I can not be ill, get in debts, lose job. Or mind. I was the only one I could count on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2014 my theater salary got reduced once again. And again in following year. 30% in total. For ten years it never covered all of my monthly expenses but this was ridiculous. It was a time for me to stop playing it safe and see what I&#8217;m made of. That was probably the most difficult decision I have ever made. A heart breaking one. Stop being musician. So I quit being Opera Prompter and started working as a full time WordPress developer.</p>\n<h3>Well, hello, World!</h3>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t really know for which wage level my knowledge was. For years I was the only WordPress developer I knew in person. The rest were all online superstars I was learning from. So I started as a shy medior and the only WordPress developer in agency. It turns out that, for this agency needs, I was senior and soon enough I was organizing and leading development processes for new projects.</p>\n<p>From the business point of view repeating similar projects makes you &#8220;niche expert&#8221;. I do understand that. But, as many other developers out there, I don&#8217;t like repeating the same tasks or projects. Not even once. I missed variety which led me to become more active contributor on wordpress.org.</p>\n<blockquote><p>For years I was just contributing to codex here and there and never really thought about all the people behind WordPress.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In my vague image, they were a bunch of really great developers and they were doing just fine. I was learning from them so I could not possibly help them. I would just be on their way.</p>\n<p>However, in my attempt to find something interesting to keep my mind amused with, I came upon <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Slack url</a> for communication between contributors on WordPress project. What a crowd! And not just developers &#8211; everyone! Doing all kinds of different bits, and all important. How odd. WordPress is not like any other open source community I saw before. So much more open and inviting! I remember reading through channels and thinking: &#8220;I could do this&#8221;, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;d love to learn that&#8221;, &#8220;This person is funny&#8221;.. I&#8217;m gonna stick.</p>\n<h3>Antisocial extrovert in a more open open source community</h3>\n<p>No matter how I tried, and I did try, I&#8217;m just not a people person. Among other antisocial treats, over the years I have developed a heavy dark humor which, more often than not, due to lack of social interactions I reveal in a completely wrong way. But these people seem not to mind so I thought to give it a try with them. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/code-of-conduct/">Code of Conduct</a> is extremely important in WordPress community. No community wants bullies. But rare communities accept social weirdos and misfits. And this one doesn&#8217;t just accept them, it makes them feel like fits. That was a nice change.</p>\n<p>I started attending local <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WP-Meetup-NS/">Meetups</a>, even gave <a href="https://www.meetup.com/WP-Meetup-NS/events/235186967/">a talk</a> on contributing to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/">Theme Review team</a> after which I was invited to join <a href="https://www.toptal.com/">Toptal platform</a> as a freelance developer. My social adventure got me volunteering on <a href="https://2017.belgrade.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Belgrade</a> and <a href="https://2017.europe.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp Europe in Paris</a>. I must admit there were &#8220;too many people at the same time&#8221; moments but there were lots of ways to stay involved with controlled dose of human interactions. I chose volunteering at Experts bar and it worked out just great. I really loved all the hugs though.</p>\n<p>Today I try to keep my focus on just a few channels in make WordPress slack and my contribution wish list regularly updated. One can have only so many hours in a day. Most often you&#8217;ll find me in <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fdocs">#docs</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/?redir=%2Fmessages%2Fcore-docs">#core-docs</a> channels, doing various stuff with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/docs/handbook/about-the-docs-team/get-involved/">Documentation</a> team.</p>\n<p><a href="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/milana-cap_wcbgd.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-2036 size-large" src="http://20094-presscdn.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/milana-cap_wcbgd-1024x683.jpg" alt="Milana, on a rooftop baclony with some other people looking at her phone" width="960" height="640" /></a></p>\n<h3>The Questions</h3>\n<p>Among all the questions I get about my professional path, the most commons are &#8220;<strong>How come you made such a huge change from music to web development?</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>Did you go to school to become a developer</strong>?&#8221; and &#8220;<strong>Do you miss being musician?</strong>&#8220;. Answer to the first question is quite easy:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Being musician and writing code are pretty much the same. They both require the same parts of your mental struggle and make you go through the same emotional tortures and enlightenments.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The second question, however, is a bit more difficult to answer. In the light of the first answer, I could say that I was exposed to the required way of thinking. Practicing an instrument 6 hours per day for over a decade does teach you a couple of things about commitment. World of classical music is a world of magnificent talents and varieties which touches you all the way to the humble self where you find appreciation for being able to feel this way. Personally, I believe this is extremely important for developer &#8211; to be humble and grateful to person who helped them find this humbleness.</p>\n<p>No, I don&#8217;t have a formal developer&#8217;s education. It doesn&#8217;t seem to prevent me from being developer. And no, I don&#8217;t miss being musician. Because I never stopped being one. I listen to classical music while I code and play piano when I have a difficult programming problem to solve.

The login flow has been completely redesigned to provide a more unified experience for connecting both self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. These flows were completely separate in the past and users were often confused about which one to select. The new design provides fewer opportunities for friction when logging in, an experience that likely determines many users&#8217; first impressions of the app.</p>\n<a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/self-hosted-login-wp-mobile-apps.png?ssl=1"><img /></a>Self-hosted login on mobile apps\n<p>&#8220;As we reimagined the login experience, there were a few key principles guiding us: keep it simple, minimize the distinction between a site hosted at WordPress.com versus somewhere else, and avoid anything that might be too clever,&#8221; Automattic mobile lead Eric Johnson said.</p>\n<p>Users can now connect new sites by entering the URL and the mobile apps will automatically detect if the site is hosted on WordPress.com or not. The new login flow ferries users on to the next step based on what kind of site is being connected. This is available in version 8.0 of WordPress for Android and version 8.2 of WordPress for iOS.</p>\n<p>The new login experience emphasizes the ease of using magic links for logging into WordPress.com. If the user enters and email address, the app will generate an authentication link and send it via email. This allows users to login without having to remember or enter a password.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/new-login-experience-wp-mobile-apps.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>If a user is entering the world of WordPress for the first time through the mobile apps, the new login experience also offers a short tour of the some of the features included in the app. These include WordPress.com features such as notifications, Stats, and the Reader. The apps, despite being marketed as the official WordPress mobile apps, are a product of Automattic and include a commercial upgrade path for WordPress.com services.</p>\n<p>The idea of the apps functioning as a gateway to help the greater WordPress ecosystem gain more users (and eventually see some graduate to self-hosted sites), no longer seems credible now that WordPress.com has <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-business-plan-gives-subscribers-a-way-to-tap-into-wordpress-orgs-third-party-ecosystem" target="_blank">entered the hosting space by allowing its customers to tap into third-party plugins and themes</a>.</p>\n<p>The updated login experience, while more convenient for users, continues to blur the line between self-hosted and WordPress.com-hosted sites. WordPress for Android and iOS used to have their own separate blogs but all of the news is now funneled through WordPress.com&#8217;s news blog and the @WordPressiOS and @WPAndroid Twitter accounts seemed to have been abandoned in favor of marketing updates through WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>In the past, many in the WordPress community have asked why the apps are not called the WordPress.com mobile apps, since they include features that are not central to the core publishing experience for self-hosted users. Last year when I <a href="https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-7-adds-path-to-upgrade-wordpress-com-plan" target="_blank">interviewed</a> Maxime Biais, one of Automattic’s mobile engineers, he said the team had considered splitting the product into two apps.</p>\n<p>“We considered having both WordPress and WordPress.com apps, but we rejected this because it doesn’t make it more clear,” Bias said. “It’s probably even more ambiguous when someone searches the Play Store for &#8216;WordPress&#8217; or &#8216;Blog&#8217; and finds both WordPress and WordPress.com apps.”</p>\n<p>Now that that mobile apps have become a direct pipeline for new WordPress.com hosting customers, it may be time to re-visit the consideration of splitting the apps into two distinct products: one for WordPress.com&#8217;s commercial interests and one that officially represents the open source WordPress project for self-hosted users without any corporate interests. If the project&#8217;s official mobile apps are a key part of new users&#8217; onboarding experience, they should accurately represent the software as an independent platform that can be hosted with and extended by any number of free and commercial products in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 16 Aug 2017 06:33:48 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:59:"WPTavern: WordCamp US to Experiment With A Community Bazaar";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74138";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:70:"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-to-experiment-with-a-community-bazaar";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2237:"<p>In addition to taking place in a new location this year, <a href="https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/">WordCamp US</a> will have a <a href="https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/attendee-information/community-bazaar/">Community Bazaar</a>. An area will be set aside in the venue allowing those chosen to showcase their WordPress communities.

Two years after Human Made began searching for a buyer, maekit purchased WP Remote to integrate it with the company&#8217;s existing platform that caters to designers managing multiple clients.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WP Remote had remained a much-loved product with its users and despite receiving no ongoing development it had remained an iconic plugin in the WordPress community,&#8221; Human Made CEO Tom Willmot said.</p>\n<p>maekit took over WP Remote operations in March after closing the deal. According to maekit CEO Matt Holme, the company inherited 20,000 users with 120,000 WordPress websites. His team has maintained WP Remote in its original platform for the past few months before integrating it into maekit last week.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wpremote.com/" target="_blank">WP Remote</a> has offered unlimited, free WordPress site management (updating core, plugins, and themes with a single click) since 2010. It hasn&#8217;t received ongoing development for several years, but maekit plans to add backup features that will make bring it more up to speed with competitors like MangeWP, MainWP, and InfiniteWP.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We definitely plan to keep WP Remote free and expand its features,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;Specifically we are looking at offering easy-to-manage cloud-based backup services. For example, hook up your Dropbox (or any other popular cloud based storage system) and schedule regular backups of your WP websites.&#8221;</p>\n<p>maekit&#8217;s acquisition of WP Remote gives the company&#8217;s customers the ability to deploy WordPress sites with one click and manage client sites and domains through a unified, white-labeled invoicing and payment system. The company has rolled out a few long-overdue bug fixes to WP Remote and Holme says the rest of maekit is functional but still technically in a closed beta mode.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our revenue model revolves around direct sale hosting plans and also reselling integrated hosting plans for other leading global hosting providers,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;We are refining the free invoicing and payment processing system built into maekit so that a maekit / WP Remote user can deploy a new hosted WP and charge their client a recurring monthly fee and retain the mark up they add on top of our base hosting prices as profit. This means literally no out of pocket expense for maekit / WP Remote users.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Although maekit&#8217;s one-click deployment service supports many popular CMS&#8217;s and e-commmerce platforms, including WordPress, Opencart, Drupal, Magento, and Joomla, Holme said the vast majority of the company&#8217;s customers are running on WordPress. Acquiring WP Remote brings a host of valuable new features to maekit&#8217;s customer base. maekit&#8217;s built-in client billing features, customized for freelancers and agencies, are what Holme says will differentiate the company from its competitors in the WordPress space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have a great deal of respect for these other WP management platforms and feel the size of the WP market means there is opportunity for all to succeed,&#8221; Holme said. &#8220;With the features of maekit also including new website deployment, invoicing, payment processing and client management, our platform is unique from the others.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 15 Aug 2017 03:50:43 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:104:"WPTavern: Gutenberg 0.8.0 Introduces 5 New Blocks: Categories, Text Columns, Shortcode, Audio, and Video";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74090";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:110:"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-0-8-0-introduces-5-new-blocks-categories-text-columns-shortcode-audio-and-video";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5712:"<p>Gutenberg <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11th-august/" target="_blank">0.8.0</a> was released over the weekend with five new blocks, major improvements to existing blocks, and support for more publishing features that have been missing from the new editor&#8217;s sidebar.

Depending on testing, it may not be the implementation that ends up landing in the plugin permanently.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been over how difficult it is to get columns right, and also how already today third parties can build this,&#8221; Joen Asmussen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2117#issuecomment-319347010" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;We may very well want an entirely different implementation than this one. But perhaps it&#8217;s good to get this in now and test it. Perhaps this can help inform how a better column implementation can work down the road. In fact we might want to merge this block in now, only to take it back out later again, same as the Cover Text block. For that reason, I think it&#8217;d be good to test this.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The new Video and Audio blocks are geared towards inserting files that have already been uploaded to the media library. However, I found the text on the video block to be confusing. If I was new to WordPress and didn&#8217;t understand how oEmbed works, I would be clicking inside the video block to figure out where to paste the URL.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/video-block.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The new Audio and Video blocks mirror the same kind of functionality that users have experienced when adding images to their sites. In the future, contributors may introduce more features to the audio block, such as additional playback types and looping, but the first iteration includes just the basics.</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 0.8.0 adds resizing handlers to the existing Image Block, making it easy for users to insert and quickly resize an image. If you review the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2213" target="_blank">GitHub ticket</a> for this feature, it&#8217;s clear that it was not easy to implement. Image resizing has gone through several changes and may have more down the road, especially as it pertains to the behavior of the caption. Ultimately, the caption field should not be wider than the image so that the two are placed together.</p>\n<p><a href="https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/image-resizing-gutenberg.png?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release introduces a post formats selector to the post settings sidebar. It includes a suggestion based on what blocks are in use in the post. One participant on the ticket noted that the suggestion gives too much importance to the post formats selection and might be confusing to users. The suggestion persists, despite a user switching the format to the one suggested. This is because Gutenberg cannot detect if it was explicitly set by the user or if the user selected the suggestion.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I happen to agree with you: post formats should go away,&#8221; Joen Asmussen <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2307#issuecomment-321232074" target="_blank">said</a>. &#8220;In fact part of the genesis of blocks as a concept is to provide a better interface than what post formats did.

Through ensuring good defaults, wrapping and bundling advanced layout options blocks, and making the most important actions immediately available, authoring content with WordPress should be accessible to anyone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The idea is to simplify content creation for users so that they only have to learn one interface &#8211; the block interface. The design document adds several new sections that elaborate on the concept of &#8220;everything is a block&#8221; and includes best practices that developers can reference when designing their own blocks.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 14 Aug 2017 22:18:21 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:115:"WPTavern: Early Results from NRKbeta’s Comment Quiz Plugin Show Readers Enjoy the Quiz but Rarely Leave a Comment";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"https://wptavern.com/?p=74105";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:123:"https://wptavern.com/early-results-from-nrkbetas-comment-quiz-plugin-show-readers-enjoy-the-quiz-but-rarely-leave-a-comment";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3492:"<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://nrkbeta.no/" target="_blank">NRKbeta</a>, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation’s media and technology site, <a href="https://wptavern.com/nrkbeta-open-sources-comment-quiz-plugin-for-wordpress" target="_blank">open sourced its comment quiz plugin for WordPress</a>. The site&#8217;s publishers have been experimenting with requiring their readers to complete a short, three-question quiz before giving access to the comment form on certain articles. The goal of the plugin was to prevent rants and off-topic responses by ensuring that commenters have read the article.</p>\n<p>NRKbeta has <a href="https://nrkbeta.no/2017/08/10/with-a-quiz-to-comment-readers-test-their-article-comprehension/" target="_blank">published some preliminary results</a> after six months of experimenting with a mandatory quiz before commenting.</p>\n<p>&#8220;On average, there are a lot more attempts – both correct and wrong – than actual comments,&#8221; NRKbeta journalist Ståle Grut said. &#8220;It seems many take the quiz to check how much they remember from the story – and not necessarily to leave a comment. Almost as a fun little game after reading.&#8221;</p>\n<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/nkrbeta-comments.jpg?ssl=1"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Grut reported that on average the quiz has an error rate of 72%. His team suspects that the bulk of the wrong answers are coming site&#8217;s international readership, as most of the articles are posted in Norwegian, which can be difficult to translate.</p>\n<p>The sample is still relatively small, because the team hasn&#8217;t yet created any set rules for when authors should enable the quiz.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea was to test it on stories that had potential for a gloomy comments section,&#8221; Grut said. &#8220;It is something we are proud to rarely have here at NRKbeta.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On one story, NRKbeta staff made an error where it was impossible to submit the correct answer to the quiz, because it wasn&#8217;t listed. As a result, this article&#8217;s quiz received more than 1,000 wrong answers.</p>\n<p>One unexpected benefit of the plugin is that it makes it more of a hurdle for readers to leave short comments, such as &#8220;nice post&#8221; that don&#8217;t add much to the conversation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This favors the most eager with the most time on their hands,&#8221; Grut said. &#8220;From time to time this has led to a decline in quality and tone, causing him to often abandon the quiz module.&#8221;</p>\n<p>These initial conclusions are in line with what we predicted when the plugin was released: the most motivated ranters are not significantly inconvenienced by a short quiz. Keeping comment sections free of trolls is not yet something that is easy to automate. It still requires time spent in the moderation queue.</p>\n<p>After the comment quiz plugin was enabled on the site, NRKbeta counted more than 300 articles around the web that had been published about the experiment. Quizzing commenters was hailed as one of the best new ideas for warding off trolls. However, the NRKbeta team cannot yet conclude whether the plugin is a success or not.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The numbers seem to show that the quiz has worked like a little game for many readers,&#8221; Grut said. &#8220;They like to take the quiz, but not to leave a comment. Being tested on how much they remember from the article seems to be the most popular use of our quiz.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 12 Aug 2017 02:54:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"WPTavern: In Case You Missed It – Issue 23";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:58:"https://wptavern.com?p=74121&preview=true&preview_id=74121";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:51:"https://wptavern.com/in-case-you-missed-it-issue-23";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6478:"<a href="https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ICYMIFeaturedImage.png?ssl=1" rel="attachment wp-att-50955"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/112901923@N07/16153818039">Night Moves</a> &#8211; <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">(license)</a>\n<p>There’s a lot of great WordPress content published in the community but not all of it is featured on the Tavern. This post is an assortment of items related to WordPress that caught my eye but didn’t make it into a full post.</p>\n<h2>Using WordPress to Publish Law Reviews</h2>\n<p>Kevin O&#8217;Keefe of Above the Law, <a href="http://abovethelaw.com/2017/08/kim-jong-un-has-much-to-teach-pentagon-about-speed-gen-hyten/">explains why</a> WordPress should be used to publish law reviews instead of printing them.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Ten years ago it would not have been as easy to set up, or license, a WordPress publishing platform by each law school. Most law professors were, and still are, publishing blogs on <a href="http://www.typepad.com/">TypePad</a>, an outdated and little used publishing software, originally produced by Six Apart.</p>\n<p>Today, WordPress is running almost 70 percent of the content management systems in the world. WordPress is regularly updated and enables a multi-user platform with multiple individual sites, all of which would be needed by a law school’s &#8216;printing press&#8217;.</p></blockquote>\n<h2>Glutenberg Free</h2>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/glutenburg-free/">Gluternberg Free</a> is a WordPress plugin developed by Adam Silverstein that restores and maintains the post editing experience from WordPress 4.8.</p>\n<h2>Open Source Candy Bar Labels for WordCamps</h2>\n<p>If you&#8217;re organizing a WordCamp and want to give out Happiness bars, check out this <a href="https://github.com/dimensionmedia/WordCamp-Happiness-Bars">custom label design</a> used at WordCamp Miami 2016.

Blog posts are easier to archive and link to, are not lost in the noise as quickly, and are a better user experience for consuming content.</p>\n<p>By the way, if you&#8217;ve already threaded a message on Twitter, Rush shares links to tools that can help capture a thread and turn it into a blog post.</p>\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content"><p><a href="https://www.customerservant.com/next-time-youre-thinking-threading-twitter-write-blog-post-instead/">The Next Time You&#8217;re Thinking About Threading On Twitter, Write A Blog Post Instead</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>The Story of HelloSales</h2>\n<p>iThemes published a <a href="https://ithemes.com/2017/08/10/story-of-our-newest-ithemes-product-hellosales/">detailed article</a> on how their newest product, <a href="https://ithemes.com/hellosales">HelloSales</a>, came to be. Cory Miller explains the product&#8217;s logo, name, and who the people are that are building it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>The rooster is essentially the symbol or emblem of Portugal. You’ll see it everywhere there when you go there (and I strongly encourage you to do so, even if I want to keep the place all to myself).</p>\n<p>It became obvious we wanted to include a rooster in the logo of HelloSales as a hat tip to Portugal and our team there. We also think it’s a great symbol for what we hope to help our customers do — make more money through their WooCommerce stores.</p>\n<p>Through several iterations of a name, we landed on HelloSales as a name, as yet another hat tip to the story — their company’s name, HelloDev — that led us here.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s a cool story and one I&#8217;d like to see more CEO and founders share when they acquire a product or business.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Telemetry Part Two</h2>\n<p>Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/case-telemetry-wordpress-morten-rand-hendriksen">updated his article</a> on the case for WordPress telemetry after a <a href="https://twitter.com/mor10/status/895299336375902209">lengthy conversation</a> on Twitter.</p>\n<blockquote><p>What WordPress needs is an open debate on this topic. What are the arguments for and against? What can be gained and what is lost? Should we do this? And if so, how do we do it in an open, transparent, and responsible way that helps inform and elevate the conversation while looking after the interests of <em>all</em> WordPress users?</p></blockquote>\n<p>These are interesting questions and although the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418">ticket</a><a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38418"> is closed</a> on Trac, users are encouraged to continue the discussion. In the future, I&#8217;d like to see data and other research published that explains <strong>why</strong> a major User Interface changing feature is necessary in core before so much energy is devoted to it.</p>\n<h2>Cowboy Wapuu!</h2>\n<p>In what is a traditional part of this series, I end each issue by featuring a Wapuu design. For those who don&#8217;t know, Wapuu is the <a href="http://wapuu.jp/2015/12/12/wapuu-origins/">unofficial mascot</a> of the WordPress project.

The development cycle kicked off in early August with Beta 1 scheduled for early October and the official release targeted for November 14.</p>\n<p>Choyce published a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/wordpress-4-9-goals/" target="_blank">list of goals</a> today that outlines what they will be aiming for in 4.9. WordPress users can expect to see some existing features polished up to be more user-friendly, including some long-awaited updates to the experience of editing theme and plugin files in the admin.</p>\n<p>Contributors are looking at <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6531" target="_blank">adding a nested folder structure</a> that will offer access to files deeper than two levels. They are also aiming to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31779" target="_blank">add better warnings</a> for users who are editing themes and plugins, an improvement which Choyce described as &#8220;graduating from cowboy coding school.&#8221; This could help prevent users from unknowingly making small errors that could have a negative impact on their sites.</p>\n<p>Another goal for 4.9 is to improve the code editing experience by adding syntax highlighting. Contributors are examining the possibility of incorporating CodeMirror functionality into the Customizer&#8217;s custom CSS box as well as the plugin and theme file editors. An experimental <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/codemirror-wp" target="_blank">Syntax Highlighting Code Editor for WordPress Core</a> plugin is currently being developed on GitHub as a potential solution for a seven-year-old trac <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423" target="_blank">ticket</a> for code editor improvements.</p>\n<p>Customizer improvements are also one of the main focuses for 4.9. Contributors to the Customize Snapshots feature plugin have been <a href="https://wptavern.com/customize-snapshots-0-6-0-adds-the-ability-to-name-and-merge-changesets" target="_blank">steadily refining</a> the ability to <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896" target="_blank">draft</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721" target="_blank">schedule</a> changesets in the Customizer. They are also looking at providing a better experience for <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39693" target="_blank">widget</a> and <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39692" target="_blank">menu mapping</a> when switching between themes, improving homepage settings (&#8220;<a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16379" target="_blank">Page on Front</a>&#8220;), and displaying responsive images in the Customizer sidebar.</p>\n<p>This list of goals for 4.9 includes many more items and the release leads are approaching it with the understanding that some features and improvements may not be ready in time. One item on the list is getting in <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Core+REST+API+Task%22" target="_blank">API endpoints that Gutenberg requires</a>.</p>\n<p>Looking ahead to WordPress 5.0, new Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister has <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/08/11/revised-suggested-roadmap-for-gutenberg-and-customization/" target="_blank">proposed a revised, tentative roadmap</a> that anticipates having the new editor ready for a merge proposal in December 2017.

This was true when Joost wrote his original <a href="https://yoast.com/articles/wordpress-seo/" rel="nofollow">WordPress SEO</a> article in 2008 (updated every few months) and it&#8217;s still true today, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t improve it further! This plugin is written from the ground up by Joost de Valk and his team at <a href="https://yoast.com/" rel="nofollow">Yoast</a> to improve your site&#8217;s SEO on <em>all</em> needed aspects. While this <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast SEO plugin</a> goes the extra mile to take care of all the technical optimization, more on that below, it first and foremost helps you write better content.  Yoast SEO forces you to choose a focus keyword when you&#8217;re writing your articles, and then makes sure you use that focus keyword everywhere.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Premium Support</strong><br />\n  The Yoast team does not always provide active support for the Yoast SEO plugin on the WordPress.org forums. One-on-one email support is available to people who bought the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo-premium/" rel="nofollow">Premium Yoast SEO plugin</a> only.<br />\n  Note that the Premium SEO plugin has several extra features too, including the option to have multiple focus keywords and a redirect manager, so it might be well worth your investment!</p>\n<p>You should also check out the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/local-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast Local SEO</a>, <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/news-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast News SEO</a> and <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/video-seo/" rel="nofollow">Yoast Video SEO</a> extensions to Yoast SEO. These of course come with support too.</p>\n<p><strong>Bug Reports</strong><br />\n  Bug reports for Yoast SEO are <a href="https://github.com/Yoast/wordpress-seo" rel="nofollow">welcomed on GitHub</a>. Please note GitHub is <em>not</em> a support forum, and issues that aren&#8217;t properly qualified as bugs will be closed.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h4>Write better content with Yoast SEO</h4>\n<p>Using the snippet preview, you can see a rendering of what your post or page will look like in the search results, whether your title is too long or too short, and whether your meta description makes sense in the context of a search result. This way the plugin will help you not only increase rankings but also increase the click through rate for organic search results.</p>\n<h4>Page Analysis</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugins <a href="https://yoast.com/content-seo-wordpress-linkdex/" rel="nofollow">Page Analysis</a> functionality checks simple things you&#8217;re bound to forget. It checks, for instance, if you have images in your post and whether they have an alt tag containing the focus keyword for that post. It also checks whether your posts are long enough, whether you&#8217;ve written a meta description and if that meta description contains your focus keyword, if you&#8217;ve used any subheadings within your post, etc. etc.</p>\n<p>The plugin also allows you to write meta titles and descriptions for all your category, tag and custom taxonomy archives, giving you the option to further optimize those pages.</p>\n<p>Combined, this plugin makes sure that your content is the type of content search engines will love!</p>\n<h4>Technical WordPress Search Engine Optimization</h4>\n<p>While out of the box WordPress is pretty good for SEO, it needs some tweaks here and there. This Yoast SEO plugin guides you through some of the settings needed, for instance by reminding you to enable pretty permalinks. But it also goes beyond that, by automatically optimizing and inserting the meta tags and link elements that Google and other search engines like so much:</p>\n<h4>Meta &amp; Link Elements</h4>\n<p>With the Yoast SEO plugin you can control which pages Google shows in its search results and which pages it doesn&#8217;t show. By default, it will tell search engines to index all of your pages, including category and tag archives, but to only show the first pages in the search results. It&#8217;s not very useful for a user to end up on the third page of your &#8220;personal&#8221; category, right?</p>\n<p>WordPress itself only shows canonical link elements on single pages, but Yoast SEO makes it output canonical link elements everywhere. Google has recently announced they would also use <code>rel="next"</code> and <code>rel="prev"</code> link elements in the <code>head</code> section of your paginated archives. This plugin adds those automatically. See <a href="https://yoast.com/rel-next-prev-paginated-archives/" rel="nofollow">this post</a> for more info.</p>\n<h4>XML Sitemaps</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin has the most advanced XML Sitemaps functionality in any WordPress plugin. Once you check the box, it automatically creates XML sitemaps and notifies Google &amp; Bing of the sitemaps&#8217; existence. These XML sitemaps include the images in your posts &amp; pages too, so that your images may be found better in the search engines too.</p>\n<p>These XML Sitemaps will even work on large sites, because of how they&#8217;re created, using one index sitemap that links to sub-sitemaps for each 1,000 posts. They will also work with custom post types and custom taxonomies automatically, while giving you the option to remove those from the XML sitemap should you wish to.</p>\n<p>Because of using <a href="https://yoast.com/xsl-stylesheet-xml-sitemap/" rel="nofollow">XSL stylesheets for these XML Sitemaps</a>, the XML sitemaps are easily readable for the human eye too, so you can spot things that shouldn&#8217;t be in there.</p>\n<h4>RSS Optimization</h4>\n<p>Are you being outranked by scrapers? Instead of cursing at them, use them to your advantage! By automatically adding a link to your RSS feed pointing back to the original article, you&#8217;re telling the search engine where they should be looking for the original. This way, the Yoast SEO plugin increases your own chance of ranking for your chosen keywords and gets rid of scrapers in one go!</p>\n<h4>Breadcrumbs</h4>\n<p>If your theme is compatible, and themes based on for instance Genesis or by WooThemes often are, you can use the built-in Breadcrumbs functionality. This allows you to create an easy navigation that is great for both users and search engines, and will support the search engines in understanding the structure of your site.</p>\n<p>Making your theme compatible isn&#8217;t hard either, check <a href="https://kb.yoast.com/kb/implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs/" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a>.</p>\n<h4>Edit your .htaccess and robots.txt file</h4>\n<p>Using the built-in file editor, you can edit your WordPress blog&#8217;s <code>.htaccess</code> and <code>robots.txt</code> file, giving you direct access to the two most powerful files, from an SEO perspective, in your WordPress install.</p>\n<h4>Social Integration</h4>\n<p>SEO and Social Media are heavily intertwined. That&#8217;s why this plugin also comes with a Facebook OpenGraph implementation and will soon also support Google+ sharing tags.</p>\n<h4>Multi-Site Compatible</h4>\n<p>The Yoast SEO plugin, unlike some others, is fully Multi-Site compatible. The XML Sitemaps work fine in all setups and you even have the option, in the Network settings, to copy the settings from one blog to another, or make blogs default to the settings for a specific blog.</p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export functionality</h4>\n<p>If you have multiple blogs, setting up plugins like this one on all of them might seem like a daunting task. Except that it&#8217;s not, because what you can do is simple: you set up the plugin once. You then export your settings and simply import them on all your other sites. It&#8217;s that simple!</p>\n<h4>Import functionality for other WordPress SEO plugins</h4>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve used All In One SEO Pack or HeadSpace2 before using this plugin, you might want to import all your old titles and descriptions. You can do that easily using the built-in import functionality. There&#8217;s also import functionality for some of the older Yoast plugins, like Robots Meta and RSS footer.</p>\n<p>Should you have a need to import from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO, or from a theme like Genesis or Thesis, you can use the <a href="https://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/seo-data-transporter/" rel="nofollow">SEO Data Transporter</a> plugin, which will easily convert your SEO meta data from and to a whole set of plugins like Platinum SEO, SEO Ultimate, Greg&#8217;s High Performance SEO, and themes like Headway, Hybrid, WooFramework, Catalyst etc.</p>\n<p>Read <a href="https://yoast.com/all-in-one-seo-pack-migration/" rel="nofollow">this migration guide</a> if you still have questions about migrating from another SEO plugin to Yoast SEO.</p>\n<h4>Yoast SEO Plugin in your Language!</h4>\n<p>Currently a huge translation project is underway, translating Yoast SEO in as much as 24 languages.

Built to integrate seamlessly with WordPress, WooCommerce is the world’s favorite eCommerce solution that gives both store owners and developers complete control.</p>\n<p>With endless flexibility and access to hundreds of free and premium WordPress extensions, WooCommerce now powers 30% of all online stores &#8212; more than any other platform.</p>\n<iframe class=''youtube-player'' type=''text/html'' width=''640'' height=''390'' src=''https://www.youtube.com/embed/1KahlicghaE?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent'' allowfullscreen=''true'' style=''border:0;''></iframe>\n<h4>Sell anything, anywhere</h4>\n<p>With WooCommerce, you can sell both physical and digital goods in all shapes and sizes, offer product variations, multiple configurations, and instant downloads to shoppers, and even sell affiliate goods from online marketplaces.</p>\n<p>With premium extensions, you can offer bookings, memberships, and recurring subscriptions. Perhaps you’d like to sell monthly subscriptions for physical goods, or offer your members a discount on digital downloads? It’s all possible.</p>\n<h4>Ship wherever you like</h4>\n<p>Offer free shipping, flat rate shipping, or make real-time calculations. Limit your shipments to specific countries, or open your store up to the world. Shipping is highly configurable, and WooCommerce even supports drop shipping.</p>\n<h4>Extensive payment options</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce comes bundled with the ability to accept major credit cards, PayPal, BACS (bank transfers), and cash on delivery. Need additional options? More than 140 region-specific gateways integrate with WooCommerce, including popular choices like Stripe, Authorize.Net, and Amazon Payments.</p>\n<h4>You control it all &#8212; forever</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce gives you complete control of your store, from taxes to stock levels to customer accounts. Add and remove extensions, change your design, and switch settings as you please. It’s all under your control.</p>\n<p>One of the biggest risks of using a hosted eCommerce platform is what happens to your store if the provider closes up shop. With WooCommerce, you have complete control, so there’s never any reason to worry. Your data belongs to you &#8212; and it’s kept secure, thanks to regular audits by industry leaders.</p>\n<h4>Define your style with Storefront</h4>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/storefront/" rel="nofollow">Storefront</a> is a free WordPress theme available to any WooCommerce store. Along with deep WooCommerce integration, Storefront prioritizes speed and uptime while eliminating theme and plugin conflicts during major updates.</p>\n<p>Define your style even further by customizing Storefront to your liking or choosing from one of our several <a href="https://woocommerce.com/product-category/themes/storefront-child-theme-themes/" rel="nofollow">Storefront child themes</a>. It’s all up to you, and all open source.</p>\n<h4>Built with developers in mind</h4>\n<p>Extendable, adaptable, and open source &#8212; WooCommerce was created with developers in mind. With its strong, robust framework, you can scale your client’s store all the way from basic to high-end (infinity and beyond).</p>\n<p>Built with a REST API, WooCommerce can integrate with virtually any service. Your store’s data can be accessed anywhere, anytime, 100% securely. WooCommerce allows developers to easily create, modify, and grow a store that meets their specifications.</p>\n<p>No matter the size of the store you want to build, WooCommerce will scale to meet your requirements. With a growing collection of more than 300 extensions, you can enhance each store’s features to meet your client’s unique needs &#8212; or even create your own solution.</p>\n<p>If security is a concern, rest easy. WooCommerce is audited by a dedicated team of developers working around the clock to identify and patch any and all discovered bugs.</p>\n<p>We also support WooCommerce and all its extensions with comprehensive, easily-accessible documentation. With our docs, you’ll learn how to create the exact site your client needs.</p>\n<h4>Extensions galore</h4>\n<p>WordPress.org is home to some amazing extensions for WooCommerce, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-google-analytics-integration/">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-delivery-notes/">Delivery Notes</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-pdf-invoices-packing-slips/">PDF Invoices and Packing Slips</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/affiliates-woocommerce-light/">Affiliates Integration Light</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce-new-product-badge/">New Product Badges</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keen to see them all?

This can be made with a cron job for example.)</li>\n<li>Improved compatibility with other plugins (There should no longer be problems with other plugins now which checked for existence of a specified function to determine if you are in the control panel or not.)</li>\n<li>Recoded plugin architecture which is now fully OOP (The code is now cleaner and better to understand which makes it easier to modify. This should also avoid namespace problems.)</li>\n<li>Improved speed and optimized settings handling (Settings and pages are only loaded if the sitemap generation process starts and not every time a page loads. This saves one MySQL Query on every request.)</li>\n<li>Added Button to restore default configuration (Messed up the config? You’ll need just one click to restore all settings.)</li>\n<li>Added log file to check everything is running (In the new log window you can see when your sitemap was rebuilt or if there was any error.)</li>\n<li>Improved user-interface</li>\n<li>Added several links to homepage and support (This includes the Notify List about new releases and the WordPress support forum.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-11-25)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added Polish Translation by <a href="http://kubazwolinski.com/" rel="nofollow">kuba</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-11-01)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added French Translation by <a href="http://www.chezthierry.info/" rel="nofollow">Thierry Lanfranchi</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.7 (2005-07-21)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Fixed bug with incorrect date in additional pages (wrong format)</li>\n<li>Added Swedish Translation by <a href="http://tobiasbergius.se/" rel="nofollow">Tobias Bergius</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.6 (2005-07-16)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Included Chinese (Simplified) language files by <a href="http://www.june6.cn/" rel="nofollow">june6</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.6 (2005-07-04)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added support to store the files at a custom location</li>\n<li>Changed the home URL to have a slash at the end</li>\n<li>Fixed errors with wp-mail</li>\n<li>Added support for other plugins to add content to the sitemap</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.5 (2005-06-15)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>You can include now external pages which aren’t generated by WordPress or are not recognized by this plugin</li>\n<li>You can define a minimum post priority, which will overrride the calculated value if it’s too low</li>\n<li>The plugin will automatically ping Google whenever the sitemap gets regenerated</li>\n<li>Update 1: Included Spanish translations by <a href="http://www.cesargomez.org/" rel="nofollow">Cesar Gomez Martin</a></li>\n<li>Update 2: Included Italian translations by <a href="http://wordpress-it.it/" rel="nofollow">Stefano Aglietti</a></li>\n<li>Update 3: Included Traditional Chinese translations by <a href="http://kirin-lin.idv.tw/" rel="nofollow">Kirin Lin</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2.2 (2005-06-08)</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Language file support: <a href="http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp/" rel="nofollow">Hiromasa</a> from <a href="http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp/" rel="nofollow">http://hiromasa.zone.ne.jp</a> sent me a japanese version of the user interface and modified the script to support it!

This makes getting the correct client IP to block slightly more complicated.</p>\n<p>The option default to NOT being behind a proxy &#8212; which should be by far the common case.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>How do I know if my site is behind a reverse proxy?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>You probably are not or you would know. We show a pretty good guess on the option page. Set the option using this unless you are sure you know better.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>Can I whitelist my IP so I don&#8217;t get locked out?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>First please consider if you really need this. Generally speaking it is not a good idea to have exceptions to your security policies.</p>\n<p>That said, there is now a filter which allows you to do it: &#8220;limit_login_whitelist_ip&#8221;.</p>\n<p>Example:<br />\nfunction my_ip_whitelist($allow, $ip) {<br />\n     return ($ip == &#8216;my-ip&#8217;) ? true : $allow;<br />\n}<br />\nadd_filter(&#8216;limit_login_whitelist_ip&#8217;, &#8216;my_ip_whitelist&#8217;, 10, 2);</p>\n<p>Note that we still do notification and logging as usual. This is meant to allow you to be aware of any suspicious activity from whitelisted IPs.</p>\n</dd>\n<dt>I locked myself out testing this thing, what do I do?</dt>\n<dd>\n<p>Either wait, or:</p>\n<p>If you know how to edit / add to PHP files you can use the IP whitelist functionality described above. You should then use the &#8220;Restore Lockouts&#8221; button on the plugin settings page and remove the whitelist function again.</p>\n<p>If you have ftp / ssh access to the site rename the file &#8220;wp-content/plugins/limit-login-attempts/limit-login-attempts.php&#8221; to deactivate the plugin.</p>\n<p>If you have access to the database (for example through phpMyAdmin) you can clear the limit_login_lockouts option in the wordpress options table. In a default setup this would work: &#8220;UPDATE wp_options SET option_value = &#8221; WHERE option_name = &#8216;limit_login_lockouts''&#8221;</p>\n</dd>\n</dl>\n<p><!--section=changelog--></p>\n<h4>1.7.1</h4>\n<p>This version fixes a security bug in version 1.6.2 and 1.7.0. Please upgrade immediately.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Auth cookies&#8221; are special cookies set at login that authenticating you to the system. It is how WordPress &#8220;remembers&#8221; that you are logged in between page loads.</p>\n<p>During lockout these are supposed to be cleared, but a change in 1.6.2 broke this. It allowed an attacker to keep trying to break these cookies during a lockout.</p>\n<p>Lockout of normal password login attempts still worked as it should, and it appears that all &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; attempts would keep getting logged.</p>\n<p>In theory the &#8220;auth cookie&#8221; is quite resistant to brute force attack. It contains a cryptographic hash of the user password, and the difficulty to break it is not based on the password strength but instead on the cryptographic operations used and the length of the hash value. In theory it should take many many years to break this hash. As theory and practice does not always agree it is still a good idea to have working lockouts of any such attempts.</p>\n<h4>1.7.0</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Added filter that allows whitelisting IP.

There are still some problems with cookie auth handling. The lockout can trigger prematurely in rare cases, but fixing it is plugin version 2 stuff unfortunately.</li>\n<li>Changed default time for retries to reset from 24 hours to 12 hours.

Considering that <strong>over 50% of keyword queries are unique</strong> and even search engines have not seen them; information retrieval relies on <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/using-lsi-based-synonyms-for-on-page-semantic-relevance/">contextual relevance</a> to determine a pages quality score determined by the domain authority.<span id="more-2553"></span></p>\n<p><a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/web-search-engine/''>Search engine</a> optimization (<a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/search-engine-optimization-2/''>SEO</a>) involves fine tuning your pages for optimal performance in search engines.  While many webmasters and <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/search-engine-optimization-2/''>SEO</a>&#8216;s only focus on <strong>metrics you can measure</strong>, there is a holistic and alchemical element that occurs naturally over time when the value of each page blends and fuses to create topical islands of relevance. This topical relevance allows pages to rank for a plethora of key phrases unintentionally and deliver an array of traffic to fuel conversion for your website.</p>\n<p>There is a <strong>window of relevance</strong> that search engines use to determine which content stays and which content goes. For example, pages from sites that have not been visited since 1997 without inbound links, references or any type of inference from peers (other sites) lack the necessary impact to remain a relevant result and are either minimized to <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/ranking/''>ranking</a> for 1-2 terms or are essentially pushed out of the index.</p>\n<p>On the contrary a new page from a trusted site or a new page from a site being linked to from other topical sites, social media sites, news aggregators, directories or editorially from various sources does have the needed ingredients to toggle the metrics necessary to be considered a relevant page and thus ensures its survival in the SERPs.</p>\n<p>Essentially, each page that crosses a <strong>relevance threshold</strong> for the on page and off page synergy starts to stem and rank for keywords found sparsely on that page. This translates into hit after hit for keyword that was not considered primary phrases for the page in question.</p>\n<p>This is typically referred to as <em>mid-tail to long-tail traffic</em>, however, this type of traffic can often exceed intentional (sought after) primary keywords consistently. In addition, using this aspect of how search engines scale relevance (before awarding a site a top <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/ranking/''>ranking</a>) <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/website-optimization-tips-for-link-building-and-seo/">keyword stemming</a> should be utilized as a strategic advantage.</p>\n<p>Mapping out the most <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-optimized/">relevant shingles</a> to define your page to search engines, then using accommodating anchor text (on page) within the site with internal links and reinforcing that with (off page) links from other sites with related topical reference (<a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/peer-review/''>peer review</a>) creates authority for those keywords and key phrases.</p>\n<p>So, for those still trying to measure the <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-services/seo-pricing-why-seo-rates-cost-so-much/"><a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/return-on-investment/''>ROI</a> of <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/search-engine-optimization-2/''>SEO</a></a> prematurely, the results are cumulative and essentially continue to overlap over time. The takeaway is, with the exceedingly high degree of click fraud occurring in <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/internet-marketing/seo-ppc-advertising-branding-or-lead-generation/"><a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/pay-per-click/''>PPC</a> </a>(up to 35% in some instances) taking control of how you communicate your pages purpose to search engines and how they evaluate your website (as a reference or authority) is an added benefit of <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/search-engine-optimization-2/''>SEO</a>.</p>\n<p>For every keyword you target with purpose, 10 more are also pulled into the spotlight (which you can use to stem and pull up multiple related pages within your website into the top 10 results).</p>\n<p>What is <strong>the value of a top 10 <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/ranking/''>ranking</a></strong> you might ask? That all depends on how trafficked the keyword or the topic are. However, aside from <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/web-traffic/''>visitors</a> typing in keywords and searching for those pages, search engines can evaluate when your content has passed the contextual point of relevance and will essentially return those pages as relevant results (when someone searches).</p>\n<p>With this in mind, you can target the low hanging fruit of today to capture the most competitive keywords in the long-run and create a pure win/win relevance model for your website.</p>\n<p>Viewing <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/search-engine-optimization-2/''>SEO</a> from this standpoint, you can reap the immediate short-term benefits of rankings funneling <a class=''wl-entity-page-link'' href=''http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/entity/web-traffic/''>visitors</a> to landing pages or take the approach of devouring market share so that &#8220;just in case&#8221; prospects search for a particular topic; your website is there at the helm of all things related.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=5s6Rr3nWUss:pCMvl1WIdDA:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/5s6Rr3nWUss" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:96:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/articles/topical-relevance-seo-and-keyword-stemming/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"28";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:91:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/articles/topical-relevance-seo-and-keyword-stemming/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:6:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:49:"Block Segmentation, Duplicate Content, SEO and IR";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~3/5cAozBpoIes/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:7:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"SEO Resources";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Avoid Duplication Across Blocks";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:37:"Search Engine Context and Duplication";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3:"SEO";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"SEO and Block Segmentation";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"SEO and IR";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:6;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"SEO Term Frequency and Co occurrence";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Sun, 14 May 2017 06:55:18 PDT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/seo-information-retrieval/";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:446:"Often you hear about the need to prevent duplicate content within your own website as it applies to SEO, but why?

For example, text in the header and footer of a document are treated differently than say text in the body section of a page.</p>\n<p>The header is given more weight than the footer and typically the body text is given more value than both (since that is where the page has the ability to distinguish itself from borrowed elements, i.e. navigation, etc.).<span id="more-1821"></span></p>\n<p>The reason for this is simple, page composition dictates that proximity and distinction (the more unique one document is from another) by distinguishing your content, the better. Search engines can easily discern duplication (through shingle analysis, singular value decomposition, etc.) in areas such as navigation, sidebars/blogrolls with the same links and footers all using the same text. This has the tendency of diffuse a pages ranking potential.</p>\n<p>In order to leverage a page for <a href="http://www.seodesignsolutions.com">SEO</a>, it must (1) get indexed and (2) stay indexed in order to pass its ideal <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/seo-theme-density-2/">ranking factor</a>, be used to bridge ranking factor as a <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/articles/hub-pages-for-seo/">hub</a> by building <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-web-design/internal-links-are-you-making-the-most-of-yours/">internal links</a> to and from that page. If search engines determine that your pages are redundant or ubiquitous the dampener kicks in algorithmically and the ranking factor can be suppressed via de-indexing or filters (<strong>like the supplemental index</strong>) as a basis of sequencing leaving the same repetitive hash mark (from document to document).</p>\n<p>This aspect of the ranking algorithm is based on the <a href="http://www.miislita.com/semantics/c-index-1.html">c-index</a> whereby <a href="http://www.miislita.com/information-retrieval-tutorial/cosine-similarity-tutorial.html">term weight</a> and similarity are used to assign relevance through <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/SingularValueDecomposition.html">singular value decomposition</a> as a base vector across web pages. If enough of the singular values are identified across the global collection of documents then you have co-occurrence (which may in this instance work against your ranking objectives).</p>\n<p>Duplication via a template or though tag pages that lack unique content can go supplemental in a secondary search index, if they are not nurtured with enough <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/what-is-the-real-value-of-a-link/">internal link flow</a>. The gist here is, the larger your website grows, the higher the probability of diffusing or diluting your global nodes / top ranking keywords (a.k.a <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/duplicate-content-and-shingle-analysis-for-seo/">keyword cannibalization</a>) like an over-optimization penalty.</p>\n<p>Just like a base that shifts to accommodate scalability, the foundation (like a triangle) must continue to broaden its base if the vertical threshold continues to rise. Similarly, the more pages you add about (1) topic A shift the focus from topic B. The common thread in most websites is the navigation (which if left to a simplistic ontology is not sufficient to feed an entire website).</p>\n<p>You can stem a websites topic into multiple topics, however each has a threshold to cross and moving on many fronts requires more inbound links and internal stability though secondary navigation to <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo/using-seo-to-sculpt-relevance-for-keyword-prominence/">sculpt the on page factors</a> that identify each segments (to pass value).</p>\n<p>This is why <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization-myths/you-cant-buy-credibility/">virtual theming</a> (linking from relevant keywords in one document to another document) is so important. It allows the ranking factor to transfer link weight to the champion page through term frequency which essentially raises the bar in how search engines will interpret each respective keyword when considering it for retrieval.</p>\n<p>Deep linking (acquiring inbound links to a specific page vs. just the homepage) is equally as beneficial for eliminating the tendency for pages to go supplemental (or lose ranking factor as a unique asset). When you spread a site too thin (expand the content through automation) such as using a shopping cart that pulls similar values from a database. You must ensure that you have the ability to customize data (titles, h1, and content) to make each page distinct enough to add additional leverage to your primary, secondary and tertiary keywords that define your website.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=5cAozBpoIes:1bPFb7KHJek:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/5cAozBpoIes" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:84:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/seo-information-retrieval/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"13";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:79:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-resources/seo-information-retrieval/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:6:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:66:"How to Build Links and Optimize your Website for Multiple Keywords";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~3/fMke79EeF5s/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Search Engine Optimization";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"Google-Link-Building-Optimization-Strategy";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10:"Google-SEO";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:45:"How-to-Optimize-Website-for-Multiple-Keywords";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"seo-techniques";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Wed, 03 May 2017 05:00:26 PDT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:133:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/how-to-build-links-and-optimize-your-website-for-multiple-keywords/";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:508:"In case you were wondering how to systematically achieve saturation for multiple keywords for your website in search engines (instead of just a few) using SEO, then this is a must read post.

I don&#8217;t mind sharing a few tactics here and there about <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/how-to-reference-material/optimizing-your-website-for-multiple-keywords/">keyword optimization</a>, as the tendency to create, test and implement them typically happens faster than I can write them down. </p>\n<p>This post in essence serves as a web-log of a fundamental technique, that we have used time and time again to bolster <a href="http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/seo-services.html">multiple top 10 positions</a> in search engines.  Naturally, we have to hold back something, otherwise we would make the SEO community obsolete, but in any case, these tactics are what we use when targeting an entire industry for long tail search engine domination, they can also be used for more aggressive/competitive terms by <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/should-you-build-links-for-competitive-terms-or-the-long-tail-of-search/">using this tactic</a>. </p>\n<p>But, in the even that you wish to rank in the top 10 for a result that has 1.2 &#8211; 1.8 million results, you can essentially pick them off like flies using just a fragment of this technique. The terms we consider worthy are usually the ones that takes months to acquire. So, don&#8217;t build links to fast from off topic locations, it&#8217;s better to focus on quality vs. quantity, however having a diverse base of IP addresses to use is ideal (such as an article marketing resource box that you can moderate) Hmmmmm. </p>\n<p><strong>The exercise:</strong></p>\n<p>1. First start off by writing down every possible singular keyword that pertains to your industry. From there narrow it down to the top 20-30 terms. </p>\n<p>You could also just use a keyword discovery tool, but in this instance, think like a consumer trying to reach your site. The reason is, many of the search terms used to reach your site are unique and do not fall into realm of showing up on the &#8220;keyword radar&#8221;, so common sense can equal conversion if you pick the right phrase and beat your competition to the punch.</p>\n<p>2. Then after you have a list of 20-30, start combining two word combinations strategically using the premise of how you think someone may type a query into a search engine.</p>\n<p>web page optimization, optimize my website, how do I SEO my site, etc&#8230; come up with your wild card list of key phrases which you can have fun with later, since if you optimize your site for one group of keywords ALL OF THE KEYWORDS in the anchor text get a boost. So even though you may be <a href="http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/link-submissions-services.html">building links</a> using exact match, you still get the benefit of each individual word in Google.</p>\n<p>3. After you have your list of 30 singular, 20 two-word combinations and 10 or so three-word combinations (just seeing if you were paying attention, since I didn&#8217;t say anything about the 3 word combinations) take each of the two and three word combinations, place the phrases &#8220;in quotes&#8221; and enter them in a standard Google search query one at a time. </p>\n<p>Look at the results of the keywords in quotes and this will give you a good indication of the allinanchor and allintitle relevance by using the quotes. Usually if you do this, you can remove the quotes and 90% of the sites remain the same. Without quotes it may be 1-10 of 2,000,000 results, with &#8220;the quotes&#8221; it may show 1-10 of 20,000. It is the term in quotes you want to look at in order to gain a metric on the competitiveness of this key phrase.</p>\n<p>Also, the more words you add, the easier it is to optimize, even if the chronology of the words does not make sense, you are still optimizing your site for any combination of keywords that are contained in the anchor text. In case it&#8217;s a new term, <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-marketing/how-to-use-article-marketing-for-building-links-traffic-seo-visibility/">this is anchor text</a>, so use it wisely as it is your number 1 tool for developing links, relevance and rankings (for now at least) in Google.</p>\n<p>Getting back to the exercise, if the term comes back with under 100,000 results then move it into your to do list of links to build as a likely target for your SEO. Granted that this is merely one tactic, feel free to combine it with your own methods. Now, without giving away too many secrets, you will be responsible for finding ways to build links. </p>\n<p>Not just any links, but links that allow you to have control over the anchor text (the text in the link). Use these terms to whittle away at the root phrases building 100 links per keyword combination, then run analytics software of check out <a href="http://www.nichewatch.com/">Niche Watch</a> and see where you stand using a before and after methodology. </p>\n<p>Every site is different, but say for example you have a PR6 site, you can skip most of these tactics and just put a keyword in your title tag, mention it a few times, build links from your own site to itself and dominate the SERPs. However, since we know that you are going to be challenging websites such as those in the SERPs as you step over them in concentration for allinanchor relevance as you specifically augment your site by fortifying it with keyword combinations, you can actually surpass a lazy or passive higher page rank site in this fashion. </p>\n<p>Our site for example can chip away and rise approximately 100,000 results per month for competitive terms using moderate link building methods (1000-2000 quality inbound links per month for example), so if we were going after a super competitive keyword such as <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;hs=4gI&amp;q=%22seo+company%22&amp;btnG=Search">&#8220;SEO Company&#8221;</a> for example with it&#8217;s 1.4 million results, it would take roughly 1 year to build links to get to the top 10 using this tactic. </p>\n<p>Each site is different as the authority that results from each link varies. The point here is, each website has a link velocity ratio that is consistent with how aggressively it can move up the rungs until it arrives in the top 10 search results for a keyword &#8220;in quotes&#8221;.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to find out where you stand for the keyword in advance, you could always click your url first, then use the search command <a href="http://www.google.com/ie?&amp;num=100">www.google.com/ie?&amp;num=100</a> to get to the 100 results per page stripped down Google interface. From there (since you have clicked your link in advance) you can put the keyword in question &#8220;in quotes&#8221;, hit return and find out where you stand. </p>\n<p>If you are position #200 for example and you are building links for every word that comprises the phrase (services SEO, SEO Services, Search engine Optimization Services, Engine Optimization SEO, etc.) then you should see your ranking move up and up closer to the top 10 for a number of terms. </p>\n<p>When it hits the top 10 for the allinanchor: terms, if the keyword is not being challenged directly by another competitor your site should hit the top 10 as well. If there is competition you should be in the top 30 or top 20 results and you will have to figure out which other SEO factor <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-web-design/are-your-seo-on-page-factors-holding-you-back/">is holding you back</a> from there.</p>\n<p>If you wanted to be more specific and chart your progress, you can find the link to link velocity ratio to determine how many links or how much time it will take you to crack into the top 10 for each of the respective search terms.  Or you could find the best page for each link using the Google command site:www.yoursite.com keyword, to increase the links per page (<a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/link-building-deep-links-using-the-lpp-ratio/">LPP ratio</a>) as a deep linking strategy to increase the impact of each link (don&#8217;t forget to socially bookmark them as well for an added boost).</p>\n<p>This is how you get your rankings to spread out to other terms. *If you use exact match terms for two word key phrases, then you can see the results usually within a week. The idea is, start with three words, when you see them moving, then alternate one of the keywords with another word from your list from before. So you can rank for keyword keyword company, keyword keyword services, keyword keyword professional, etc.</p>\n<p>Examples like SEO Marketing Consultant, SEO Website Marketing, Internet SEO Marketing, etc&#8230; this will become apparent later just how effective this tactic can be for blanketing a plethora of terms. </p>\n<p>Then you focus specifically on the phrase you want to rank for, create a custom page using a keyword density tool or writing copy that utilizes the phrase one time in the title, one time in the h1 tag, one to 3 times in the document and continue to build links to that page with those keywords in the anchor text. This is the advantage of having a blog as you can camouflage your link building tactics under the guise of an informative post. I will just hint at SEO content copy writing here, but you get the gist (link bait, social media, social bookmarking / link building ahem, ahem).</p>\n<p>My suggestion, build 50 links to the page and move on to another term. Then give it a week or two and go back and <a href="http://www.nichewatch.com/">check the status of the keywords</a> and how your allinanchor:, allintitle: and allintext: ratio&#8217;s are performing is contrast to the keyword combinations, make note of your progress and try to find your site in the SERPs again. You can go back to the Google interface and check or you can just scroll through the normal results to see where you stand.</p>\n<p>If the keywords you select are under 20,000 results, if your site has some authority you can take those over from just posting an <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/titles-and-tagging-for-seo-conversion-relevance/">on topic post that is tagged properly</a> in your blog. But to sustain them, you have to feed the pages keyword combinations to keep them afloat in the SERPs. This also provides a cushion around them to help fend off competition from leap-frogging past you up the ladder.</p>\n<p>Acquisition (climbing the rungs) and defense from others can be done through varying the tactic slightly. Slow down once you have acquired a top 20 and let the link velocity push you up the ladder. Then you can build 1/3 of the links using the exact match terms until you hit the top 10. If you crack the top 10, then go back, add a few more occurrences of the keywords you want to rank for in your document/page. Add a few more links, wait a week and then see if that pushes you over the hump into the top 5.</p>\n<p>This method may seem a bit chaotic, but you get the gist, you can manage one keyword or several at the same time. The key is to use a common denominator as the pivotal term that is used to tie together all of the variations of the word stemmed singular, plural and adjective based keyword combinations until you have effectively saturated each keywords density in the external links to your site.</p>\n<p>You can always check on Google Webmaster tools which keywords have the highest occurrences that are directed at your site. The idea is, to build a base term, add a qualifier, then do this again and again, until all of your main keywords are essentially lodged in the anchor text pointing at your site from a wide variety of unique and Class C- IP addresses.</p>\n<p>For example if you did a search on a term like &#8220;seo professional&#8221; this term returns 126,000 results. If your site has a PR4 for example and you have content that supports this type of industry of jargon in your domain name, on your pages or in your page titles, you should already have some leverage for the term.</p>\n<p>Terms that have slight correlation to your site&#8217;s theme can be optimized, but the rate of which all depends on your website authority, the links you use and how much link juice they carry, where you point them, the competition and how algorithms see your link building techniques (natural or unnatural) if you invoke a penalty, you will not rank for that term for a while until it&#8217;s lifted, so it&#8217;s better not to get greedy and vary your titles, anchor text and pages when deep linking.</p>\n<p>I hope you found this information useful, if you did, then cast your vote to share it, sign up for the RSS feed or just enjoy&#8230;See you in the SERPs.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=fMke79EeF5s:vRkBGj361aA:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/fMke79EeF5s" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:138:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/how-to-build-links-and-optimize-your-website-for-multiple-keywords/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"58";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:133:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/how-to-build-links-and-optimize-your-website-for-multiple-keywords/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:6:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:63:"How to Get SEO, Call to Action and Conversion on the Same Page!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~3/WawDDa-5Yn0/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"SEO Marketing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:14:"call-to-action";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:23:"Higher-Sales-Conversion";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Problem-Solution-Marketing";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:19:"SEO-&-Squeeze-Pages";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"What-SEO-is-NOT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Mon, 01 May 2017 10:02:55 PDT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:120:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-marketing/how-to-get-your-seo-call-to-action-and-conversion-on-the-same-page/";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:491:"SEO is nice for popularity, but conversion is even better.

Instead of thinking in terms of &#8220;the money phrase&#8221;, or, <strong>as soon as I hit the top 10</strong> for &#8220;my ultimate competitive keyword&#8221;, that floodgates of website traffic will open, sales will inundate our sales team and we will have to hire 20 people to scale our sales department to keep up with the surge of orders and traffic. This is not to say that things like this do not happen, they do, but rarely as a result of one keyword alone.<br />\n<span id="more-105"></span></p>\n<p><strong>Don&#8217;t believe keyword hype</strong></p>\n<p>The misconception typically originates as a result of assumption, or misinformation gleaned from data mining tools / keyword research tools (it says this phrase gets 20,000 hits per month, so it must), which is understandable. I can assure you, we have dominated multiple rankings in top 10 competitive keywords with double organic listings, only to be disappointed by the lack of traffic that resulted. Yet, on the other hand, been completely surprised when you write  or optimize something (supposedly less competitive) and experience surges of traffic for weeks from one keyword you may or may not have expected.  </p>\n<p>It is important to be clear <strong>what search engine optimization is not</strong>, in order to know what it truly is. <strong>SEO is not the answer to conversion</strong>, it is just a tool to rouse the masses to investigate your offer, but ultimately the responsibility lies within the realm of the individual or individuals structuring the offer, to determine just what the anticipated end result will be.</p>\n<p><strong>Are your Pages Eye Candy? or do they Own a Focus</strong></p>\n<p>The internet is full of hungry eyes with agile minds attached, so many in fact, that your pages may just be another snack along the way. In order to change the menu and make your site <strong>&#8220;the main course&#8221;</strong>, nine times out of ten, some changes need to occur to make the transition from pages with an idle online existence to a page that for lack of better terms, offers you a deal you can&#8217;t refuse.</p>\n<p><strong>What Can You Learn (and apply to your own site) from a Squeeze Page</strong></p>\n<p><strong>First, the headline</strong> &#8211; <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/small-business-marketing/action-words-and-conversion/">Call to Action and Conversion</a> Starts Here. When you look at a typical squeeze page, once you get there, there is no question what the page is about, in fact they make it hard to see anything other than what the topical relevance is when you first set eyes on the page, but why? Because the headline takes up 25% of the screen, is usually in a ridiculously loud color, with quotes and highlighted in yellow. Anyone who fails at that point to surmise what the contextual relevance is for being there, should have their internet license suspended for surfing blind without emotional attachment. </p>\n<p>In any case, the point being, the pages, despite how obnoxious they are serve a very fundamental purpose, which is to set the tone and funnel the reader&#8217;s attention to the meat and potatoes of the document (typically found at the very bottom alongside a pay pal purchase button). This is were the old adage of (A.I.D.A) attention, interest, desire, action comes into play in it&#8217;s sublime simplicity. </p>\n<p><strong>Next, the testimonial</strong>, but why? Because they know you are skeptical and they know they need to subvert your defenses in order to engage the rational mind behind the emotional response when you shop (do I need this or do I want this, can I ignore or suppress the urge to purchase, or am I genuinely interested) all the while thousands of queries such as this race through the subconscious and either lead your to (a) move along (b) read further, since your there or (c) take the plunge and purchase, because, what the hay, it&#8217;s only money right.</p>\n<p><strong>Next, the problem / solution</strong>, which is usually built on the premise of using questions to preface it&#8217;s significance. Are you tired of? &#8220;the problem&#8221; Do you get frustrated when? Now you can be free of, by using our super duper X,Y,Z solution for mere chump change (only $39.95) for the ultimate answer to your prayers. </p>\n<p>O.k, so I was a bit over the top, but I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s not the first time you have seen this pitch,  purchased or nearly purchased something as a result of it. Most of us are conditioned not to respond to such an overtly obvious pitch, however, I must admit, I am an impulse shopper and randomly purchase e-books in this fashion and never get around to reading them (the ideal customer for squeeze pages).</p>\n<p><strong>Then, the close,</strong> here is where they hit you with information about the product or service with the focus is on the &#8220;how you can benefit&#8221; mentality and inevitably the call to action, ORDER NOW!, ORDER TODAY, ORDER IN THE NEXT 5 MINUTES AND RECEIVE A FREE &#8220;rubber ducky, widget,etc.&#8221;, once again, it&#8217;s all about conversion.</p>\n<p>Sure that page may get 1000 visitors that day, and from that 1000 visitors <strong>100 order</strong>, that is more than enough to offset the other 900 that did not, so you can see the beauty in their plan. Pages like this could teach a great deal to businesses seeking conversion for their efforts instead of just visitors window shopping and burning up bandwidth, and I must admit even our pages in the main site need to take the positive benefits from such a blatant business model. The squeeze page is just that, a page that funnels their attention to a conclusion and then compels them to take action.</p>\n<p><strong>Have you heard of Funneling Attention for Higher Conversions? </strong></p>\n<p>Business models that make money are using the funneling tactic to amass massive amounts of income, using a tried and true / simplistic theme. Even though is mainly has it&#8217;s place in direct sales, affiliate programs, sales for e-books or inexpensive items. I have seen this tactic used for offers in the thousands and still convert readers (it just took more filler in the middle to build the argument and present the solution). Getting back to the basis of this article, the conclusion is SEO does not ensure conversion, it merely sets the stage.</p>\n<p>Branding is one thing, but how many people are online just for the sake of saying &#8221; I am the number one brand for industry X&#8221;, perhaps this is important for corporate America, sure, but,for the rest of us out here trying to make ends meet, we need conversion in some way shape or form.</p>\n<p>Knowing this, instead of thinking narrow when it comes to using SEO, one could opt for a more holistic approach whereby they identify the behavior of the types of clients they would like to attract, thinking of individuals as opposed to demographics from a one dimensional prospective. If you think holistically, you can cover your bases and <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/are-you-google-sighted-or-can-you-see-the-big-picture-of-search/">optimize entire segments of the niche</a> as well as use multiple tactics and search engines to draw traffic from a variety of queries and implement &#8220;attention and retention insurance&#8221; for all of your respective offers. </p>\n<p>For example, instead of one or two phrases, why not have twenty instead, it essentially takes about the same amount of effort and can be accomplished through modifying slight variations of content and <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/search-engine-optimization/how-to-build-links-and-optimize-your-website-for-multiple-keywords/">how your build links</a>.</p>\n<p>Just having a top 10 ranking does not ensure traffic, simply because, not all keywords convert! It truly is sad to see so many people just scratching the surface for topical relevance, when in reality mosts sites are capable of acquiring heightened depth (for readership) and conversion and could achieve 400% more times the amount of traffic from just applying rudimentary steps to lead people through the &#8220;expected action for that page&#8221;. But, they have to get there first, so my suggestion in a nutshell is, to <strong>optimize root phrases with pertinent keywords</strong> instead of simple &#8220;exact match key phrases&#8221;, use strong internal links to get viewers deeper into the site and use graphics or video&#8217;s to cut the bounce rates in half.</p>\n<p>We will continue along these lines for the next few days and covering topics related to SEO, conversion, structuring your offer and how the way you craft your content, ultimately impacts the bottom line.

The stronger the backlink the more value it can pass to your site as far as aiding your pages in maintaining or increasing positioning.<span id="more-204"></span></p>\n<p>If you have ever tagged a site using social bookmarking, then you have scratched the surface. For example social bookmarking utilizes the premise of <strong>link insurance</strong>. Not only is it great to seal the deal with spiders (by getting their attention), but with enough inbound links strategically augmenting a page, it can provide long-term value for the <strong>link-freshness factor</strong> which can keep your internal pages buoyant and moving up in the search engine rankings.</p>\n<p>A stable authority site (built over time with a tremendous amount of link weight) has less chance of losing favor with search engine algorithms. However, what about other transient links, that drop off, get buried over time or the site architecture from the site offering the link is so taxed that by the time the pages are spidered <strong>they are tapped out</strong> as far as their real value is concerned? What is a viable solution to revive potential rankings?</p>\n<p><strong>The Solution: Building links to your links as insurance</strong></p>\n<p>I am not suggesting to abuse this tactic, what I am insinuating is, maintaining a stable influx of link juice into a site benefits all of the pages in that site (as long as you distribute the inbound links in moderation). The premise here is, <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/balancing-link-diversity-link-velocity-and-link-volume/">balancing</a> the ratios of content development to inbound links (and their various anchor and modifiers) along with systemic deep linking is the cornerstone of relevance of <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/seo-basics/seo-basics-using-allinanchor-allintitle-allintext/">SEO basics</a> in action.</p>\n<p>Links also can have more internal value from a page that was recently promoted in the Google algorithm. For example, if a page went from a page rank of zero to a PR2 or PR3 page in one update, if it gets indexed regularly and is succinctly tied to the sites main navigation, then you have an authority link right under your nose you can use to augment your main keywords as you wish.</p>\n<p>You can always review such content an amend it for a common goal. Ten links from <a href="http://seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/using-deep-links-to-summon-search-engine-spiders/">strong internal pages</a> to a sub folder or page buried deep in the site can change the landscape of a page or sites SEO value. Combining this with the fact that you can point new links from those pages at older links (to keep them fresh) or use them to kick off new content with a splash, the possibilities for recycling your sites internal link dynamo is promising.</p>\n<p><strong>One Example of the Equation:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1)</strong> Find a slouching ranking and determine a keyword you want to invigorate<br />\n<strong>2)</strong> use a site:yourdomainname.com keyword (command) to find the most relevant page in your site<br />\n<strong>3)</strong> Build a new page using the <strong>main keyword in the title and text</strong><br />\n<strong>4)</strong> Link to the new page from the old page (with page rank) using the (keyword) as the anchor text / link text<br />\n <strong>5)</strong> publish your content<br />\n<strong>6)</strong> build links back to the old page (using social bookmarking or other ethical link building methods) to flow link weight back to your site and your new page.</p>\n<p>When the page gets crawled, it already has the ranking factors intact, relevance and an endorsement from your own internal links. This is a great strategy for a maiden voyage for a new page, although this is a rudimentary version of the tactic, you can see the value in building links to your links.</p>\n<p>Every three months, you could essentially go back through your analytics, look at the most searched keywords, perform an audit and ensure that your older links are getting enough nurturing as a result of fresh links. The stronger they are the stronger your site is.</p>\n<div class="feedflare">\n<a href="http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?a=SbAgitQy41g:ytdtE7dvXFE:yIl2AUoC8zA"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog?d=yIl2AUoC8zA" border="0"></img></a>\n</div><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~4/SbAgitQy41g" height="1" width="1" alt=""/>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:36:"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/";a:1:{s:10:"commentRss";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:107:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/managing-link-weight-and-building-link-insurance/feed/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:38:"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/";a:1:{s:8:"comments";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2:"30";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:42:"http://rssnamespace.org/feedburner/ext/1.0";a:1:{s:8:"origLink";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/link-building/managing-link-weight-and-building-link-insurance/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:0:"";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:4:{s:0:"";a:6:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:65:"Your Website Needs Internal Links… Here’s How to Automate It!";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://feeds.seodesignsolutions.com/~r/SeoDesignSolutionsBlog/~3/LfAszNY6W9E/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:8:"category";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"WordPress SEO";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:29:"Thu, 13 Aug 2015 07:32:30 PDT";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/?p=9565";s:7:"attribs";a:1:{s:0:"";a:1:{s:11:"isPermaLink";s:5:"false";}}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:486:"I know it&#8217;s been quiet on our blog, but, just to let you know&#8230;.we&#8217;ve been busy creating our new [10 Video] Advanced SEO Training Series for SEO Ultimate and SEO Ultimate+ so that people can really see the power of this amazing All-in-One solution for WordPress.

Billions of videos are viewed every month on YouTube, meaning there is a very high chance that your video will get many views once you post it.</li>\n<li>You will reach targeted Web traffic. Recent research by Nielsen shows that YouTube gets the most visits from adults aged between 18 and 34.</li>\n<li>It is free to post a video on YouTube, meaning you can put your advertising dollars elsewhere.</li>\n<li>Your YouTube campaign will help you get a more targeted mailing list by asking people who view your videos to sign up to your mailing list. People who have viewed and liked your videos are more likely to buy from you (and to recommend your company/products to their friends).</li>\n<li>You will be able to demonstrate products, which is particularly important if your physical distribution channel is limited.</li>\n<li>If you want to build a community for your business or the business already has a community, YouTube videos are a tool to engage and share with customers. As an example, you could have video blogs or event footage for your customers if you are a bicycle retailer.</li>\n<li>YouTube will help you build your reputation as a guru in your field.

This shows that Google values videos as much as it does text pages. Videos hosted on YouTube will help you reach many people.</p>\n<p><strong>2)</strong> The fact that there are millions of videos on YouTube poses a challenge in that you will be competing with very many videos. If you want improved visibility, consider running a YouTube search engine optimization (<a href="http://www.seodesignsolutions.com">SEO</a>) campaign. Several SEO tactics will greatly increase the visibility of your video.</p>\n<p><strong>3)</strong> YouTube allows you to include a video description for every video. Since Google and YouTube cannot listen or watch your video yet, they rely on the description to understand the topic of your video. The description should be keyword-optimized. Take all other precautions you would with other search engine optimized text (such as ensuring the content is unique).</p>\n<p><strong>4)</strong> Consider optimizing around “video keywords.” Note that although YouTube videos have an edge on Google’s SERP, this is only true for some keywords. These are called “Video Keywords.” As an example, you expect a few video results when you use the keyword “cute cats” (which makes sense since the person who searches for this keyword is most likely looking for a video, not an article on cute cats). On the other hand, someone searching for the keyword “muscle aches” is most likely looking for an article.</p>\n<p><strong>5)</strong> A proven YouTube SEO tactic is getting your videos to online communities. You can achieve this by sharing your YouTube videos on these communities. Online communities comprise of people who have similar interests and so you will get more high-retention traffic if you find the right community.</p>\n<p><strong>6)</strong> YouTube algorithm values user experience signals because it does not use backlinks. You should therefore ensure your videos are interesting since subscribing and liking are the most important YouTube user experience signals, in that order. Simply asking people to like, subscribe, share, and/or share is an effective way of achieving this.</p>\n<p><strong>7)</strong> Consider creating playlists and ensure they are keyword-rich. Organize your YouTube channel and you will realize more YouTube traffic. YouTube gets deeper info about the topics of your videos from keyword-rich playlists.</p>\n<p><strong>8)</strong> The name of the video should have the word “video” whenever possible and it should include an appropriate keyword. This is because most people search for videos using keywords and include the word “video” after the keyword.</p>\n<p><strong>9)</strong> You should watermark your videos. The best video editing software programs allow you to place small translucent logos in the corner of your videos. Watermarks help give more credibility to your videos.</p>\n<p><strong>10)</strong> Advertise your channel on your website, your blog, on article submission directories, and everywhere else possible because the more channel views you get, the higher it will rank in its niche.</p>\n<p><strong>11)</strong> You could create different accounts and comment on the videos to get things rolling (never attempt to do this using a single account since YouTube considers this a Grey Hat SEO tactic). Consider enticing some drama since people like flocking to conflict.</p>\n<p><strong>12)</strong> YouTube considers the number of dislikes when ranking videos and you should, therefore take pre-emptive action when you start receiving negative feedback. It might be necessary to bring down your video to ensure it does not give your channel a bad name.</p>\n<p><strong>13)</strong> Link building remains one of the most effective SEO tactics. You should therefore consider having links to your website in the video description. This not only helps your SEO efforts, but it also gives you targeted web traffic.</p>\n<p><strong>14)</strong> Give views more options by including audio cues and illustrations over and above video and text. This increases the overall engagement the video receives since you will be catering to varying learning styles.</p>\n<h3><strong>Other Helpful Tips</strong></h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-9481 size-full" src="http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/youtube-analytics-banner.jpg" alt="youtube-analytics-banner" width="600" height="292" srcset="http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/youtube-analytics-banner.jpg 600w, http://www.seodesignsolutions.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/youtube-analytics-banner-300x146.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>\n<p>YouTube Insights is an analytics feature that gives you such information as demographics and the point at which people stopped watching a particular video. This data will help you produce better videos in the future.</p>\n<p>YouTube uses thumbnails to help people who are searching through videos. It takes these thumbnails from the ¼, ½, and ¾ marks. Choose the most appropriate thumbs to display. You could try to manipulate videos (if this will not be disruptive) for you to get the most compelling images at these points. Thumbnails greatly affect the click-through rate.</p>\n<p>Combine SEO with other website promotion tactics such as article submission for the best results.</p>\n<p>Consider such things as the length and quality of your video as this determines if your audience will watch the video to the end.</p>\n<p><strong>Author Bio:</strong> Lalit Sharma is an SEO consultant who runs a SEO house called <a href="http://www.rankingbyseo.com/seo-services-india.html" rel="nofollow">Ranking By SEO</a>.

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry''s standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.\r\n\r\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>\r\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using ''Content here, content here'', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for ''lorem ipsum'' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\r\n\r\n</div>', 'Satish Kumar', '', 'inherit', 'closed', 'closed', '', '86-revision-v1', '', '', '2017-05-12 08:12:20', '2017-05-12 07:12:20', '', 86, 'http://universalmartialarts.in/86-revision-v1/', 0, 'revision', '', 0),
